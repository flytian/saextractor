<h1>Postgraduate research and training </h1>
   

<h2>General </h2>

<p>
  The group accepts research students to study for a postgraduate (second) degree. 
    Most of these proceed to submit a thesis for the D.Phil. (Oxford's version of a Ph.D.), 
    but they are enrolled in the first instance as a Probationary Research Student (PRS). 
    Progression to D.Phil. status is subject to satisfactory progress and passing a change of 
   status exam, typically 11-12 months after entry. For a D.Phil. the minimum period of 
    residence in Oxford is six terms - i.e. two years - but it is very unusual for a thesis to be 
    completed successfully in less than three years. Special permission is needed to 
   submit after four years have elapsed. 
   Potential students are normally expected to fund their own funding although applicants 
   who are EU residents are eligible for EPSRC postgraduate studentships (this pays 
    fees but not a living expenses stipend). Occasionally, studentships associated with 
     research grants are avaliable. Any current opportunities are advertised 
     <a href="phd-opportunities.php">here </a>. 

    <h2> Gaining entry to study for a doctoral degree </h2>

    <p>
     Candidates must normally possess a good first-class degree in an appropriate subject. 
     This usually means a B.Sc./M.Eng./B.Eng./M.Sc. degree with a large component of 
     engineering, mathematics, physics, computer science or statistics. 
      Intending applicants should complete the formal application forms which can be 
     obtained from the <a href="http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/postgraduate/"> University Graduate 
     Admissions Office </a> website .  This is a useful website which in particular tells
     you about deadlines for receipt of applications (this is new from October 2005 entry) 
     - make sure that you apply early to ensure
     that you are considered for any valid scholarship scheme (eg, a Clarendon award).
     This will then be forwarded to the relevent faculty in the Department of Engineering 
     for their consideration (it helps here if you specifically mention "medical imaging" or
     "medical image analysis" in your application).  
      <p>
      If you are interested in joining the Wolfson MVL team, it is suggested that you first look at the
      <a href="../research/research-overview.php"> Research </a> webpages and
      then contact <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sarchdal/MikeBrady.html"> 
      Mike Brady </a>,  <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sarchdal/alisonspage.html">
      Alison Noble </a>, or <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sarchdal/Mengxing.html">
      Mengxing Tang</a>. They will be able to advise you on current opportunities. 

      <p>
      You should also take a look at the <a href="http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk"> 
      Department of Engineering Science </a>   and <a href="http://www.lsi.ox.ac.uk/"> 
      Life Sciences Interface DTC </a> websites which provide further details on 
      how to apply to their respective graduate programmes.
   
      <p>
      You may also like to look at our webpage on <a href="colleges.php"> Colleges </a>
      which lists the college associations of laboratory members. Every student at Oxford
      is a member of a department and a college. You may find it useful
      to contact people on the list to find out a more personal view of individual colleges.
