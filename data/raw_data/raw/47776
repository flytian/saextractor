		  Project</FONT></H2> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">The Alfredian
		Boethius Project began in 2002, and its primary aim is to enhance understanding
		of the Anglo-Saxon adaptation and appropriation of late Roman culture,
		especially in the circle of King Alfred. The project aims over the next five
		years to undertake intensive research into the history and background of the
		Anglo-Saxon interest in Boethius, and particularly the Anglo-Saxon versions of
		his <I>De Consolatione Philosophiae</I>, or 'On the Consolation of
		Philosophy'.</FONT></FONT> 
		<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">The main areas it hopes
		  to focus on are:</FONT></FONT> </P> 
		<UL> 
		  <LI> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">the origins of the
			 mass of information about classical history and legend, the natural world and
			 the human psyche which is used in the adaptation of the Latin text to fit a
			 later and less classically-learned world</FONT></FONT></LI> 
		  <LI> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">the purposes and
			 mentality behind the very extensive adaptation of the arguments and
			 illustrations of Boethius, and their implications for the assessment of the
			 cultural achievements of the Alfredian period and its political
			 ideology</FONT></FONT></LI> 
		  <LI> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">the text as a focus
			 for debate about Old English metrics and poetic composition</FONT></FONT></LI> 
		  <LI> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">the evidence which
			 the successive copies of the text provide for the development of the English
			 language</FONT></FONT></LI> 
		  <LI> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">the relationship of
			 the Anglo-Saxon translations to the tradition of glossing and commentary which
			 survives in Latin manuscripts throughout Europe, and to the textual tradition
			 of the <I>De Consolatione</I> itself</FONT></FONT></LI> 
		  <LI> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">the stylistic,
			 linguistic and intellectual relationships between the Old English Boethius and
			 other works of the period, especially the two most closely linked Alfredian
			 texts, the Soliloquies and the Orosius, with a view to establishing a sounder
			 base for views on authorship and on the cultural connections of these
			 texts</FONT></FONT></LI> 
		</UL> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">The Project organises
		annual symposia to explore and publicise these issues, and reports on work in
		progress on this website and at major conferences. The results of this work
		will be presented in a new, expansive and thorough edition of the Alfredian
		Boethius, with introduction, commentary, translation and glossary, to be
		published by Oxford University Press in about 2009.</FONT></FONT>

		preparing new digital images of the burnt Cotton manuscript, which will allow
		better access to the damaged text than has ever been possible since the Cotton
		fire of 1731. Our own project will be helping to organise the production of
		digital images of the two Oxford manuscripts as part of that

		<H2> <A NAME="Boethius"></A><FONT
		  FACE="Times New Roman">Boethius</FONT></H2> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT
		SIZE="+1">Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius was a Roman scholar and statesman,
		a prominent member of the Roman senate in the early sixth century and a leading
		counsellor to the Ostrogothic king Theoderic, who ruled Italy from 493 to 526.
		In 523, at the height of his influence and power, Boethius suddenly fell from
		favour, accused by fellow-senators of plotting against the king. He was sent
		into exile, and perhaps imprisonment, in Pavia, and was killed, apparently at
		the king's orders, in 524.</FONT></FONT> 
		<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">While in exile in Pavia
		  Boethius wrote his most famous work the <I>De Consolatione Philosophiae</I> in
		  which he sought through philosophy to come to terms with the vicissitudes of
		  fortune and the apparent triumph of evil. Written in Latin prose interspersed
		  with more lyrical or impassioned passages in verse, the work was to become one
		  of the seminal texts of the European Middle Ages; the Anglo-Saxon adaptations
		  associated with King Alfred were the first of many in English, including
		  versions by Chaucer and later Queen Elizabeth I.</FONT></FONT> </P> 
		<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1"><A HREF="#top">Back to

		<H2> <A NAME="AngloSaxons"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Boethius and
		  the Anglo-Saxons</FONT></H2> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">The
		widespread fame and serious study of Boethius's <I>Consolation of
		Philosophy</I> seems to have begun at the end of the eighth century with its
		discovery by Alcuin (c.735 - 804), the Anglo-Saxon scholar who left York for
		the court of Charlemagne in the 780s and spent most of the remaining years of
		his life on the Continent, writing, teaching and advising. He may have found
		the text on a visit to Italy. Through the ninth century it became intensively
		studied, quoted and commented on over much of the Carolingian world; its
		philosophy, its metrical varieties, its science and its allusions to classical
		legend, history and literature, all became part of the academic curriculum.
		Although the influence of Boethian ideas has sometimes been posited by modern
		scholars in early Anglo-Saxon poems such as <I>Deor </I>and <I>The
		Wanderer</I>, the first clear evidence of interest in the work comes in the
		late ninth century. A copy of the Latin text made in France in the middle of
		the ninth century (now in the Vatican) had reached Britain by the end of the
		century, when notes and glosses were added in a script characteristic of Wales
		or south-west England; the manuscript was later glossed and annotated further
		in southern England, by St Dunstan among others. Glossed copies and Latin
		commentaries were to become common in England in the tenth and eleventh
		centuries. But the most significant development was the ninth-century
		translation and adaptation of the text attributed to King Alfred.</FONT></FONT>
		
		<H3> <A NAME="Alfred"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Boethius and King
		  Alfred</FONT></H3> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">King Alfred's
		programme for a series of translations of the major Latin works of the past is
		set out in the prefatory letter with which he introduced the first of his own
		translations, that of Gregory the Great's <I>Regula Pastoralis</I>. There he
		urges the importance of both teaching the young to read English and making
		books available to them in that language, and notes the help he has had from a
		series of English and foreign advisers, including the Welshman Asser, John the
		Saxon and Grimbald the Frank. The king himself is generally thought to have
		been responsible for the versions of the <I>De Consolatione</I> and the
		<I>Regula Pastoralis</I> that survive, and also for two other substantial
		translations into Old English, each surviving in just one later
		manuscript:</FONT></FONT> 
		<UL> 
		  <LI> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">a translation of the
			 first fifty psalms, complete with brief introductions explaining the origins
			 and meaning of each psalm</FONT></FONT></LI> 
		  <LI> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">an ambitious
			 adaptation and continuation in English of St Augustine of Hippo's unfinished
			 early philosophical work, the Soliloquies.</FONT></FONT></LI> 
		</UL> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">Two other translations
		that were closely associated with the king are:</FONT></FONT> 
		<UL> 
		  <LI> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">a version, by an
			 unknown Anglo-Saxon contemporary of King Alfred, of the <I>History of the World
			 against the Pagans</I> by the early fifth-century Spanish priest and friend of
			 St Augustine, Orosius</FONT></FONT></LI> 
		  <LI> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">a rendering of
			 Gregory the Great's <I>Dialogues</I>, translated at the king's request by

		<H2> <A NAME="Versions"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Versions of
		  the Anglo-Saxon Boethius</FONT></H2> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT
		SIZE="+1">There are two versions of the Anglo-Saxon adaptation of the
		<I>Consolation of Philosophy</I>, one all in prose and the other alternating
		verse and prose, and the history and relationship of these two is one of the
		great issues of current Anglo-Saxon scholarship.</FONT></FONT> 
		<H3> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Bodley Version</FONT></H3>
		<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">What is probably the first version
		survives only in a twelfth-century manuscript now in Oxford, MS Bodley 180.
		This begins with a preface identifying Alfred as author (though in the third
		person), and then goes on to give a table of contents, dividing the work into
		42 chapters, and an introductory account of Boethius and the circumstances
		which led up to the composition of the work. This is followed by a rendering of
		the work itself in Old English prose. The text is very freely adapted, with
		much new material reflecting Alfredian concerns and expansions of the many
		allusions to classical legend and history.</FONT></FONT> </BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">The preface
		reports that the king wrote the text first in prose and then turned it into
		verse 'as is now done'. What follows is nevertheless all in prose, but the
		other version which survives does indeed use verse.</FONT></FONT> 
		<H3> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Cotton Version</FONT></H3>
		<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">This survives only in a manuscript
		of the mid-tenth century, now in London, British Library MS Cotton Otho A vi.
		Much of the text in this version corresponds closely with that in the Bodley
		version, but there is an additional brief preface in verse, identifying Alfred
		again as the author of this version, the introduction on Boethius and his
		circumstances has been turned into verse, and so have some thirty sections of
		the prose translation itself - the parts which were designated in the prose
		version as 'songs' or 'poems' and which correspond to metrical passages in the
		original Latin text. This version thus alternates between prose and verse
		throughout its length.</FONT></FONT> 
		<H3> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Junius Version</FONT></H3>
		<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">The Cotton Otho manuscript was
		very badly damaged in the great Cotton fire of 1731, which destroyed or damaged
		many of the medieval manuscripts collected by Sir Robert Cotton in the 16th and
		17th centuries, including the only manuscript of <I>Beowulf</I>. Fortunately
		the Dutch antiquarian and scholar Francis Junius had made a copy of the Oxford
		manuscript in the 17thC and collated it carefully with the Cotton version,
		copying the different readings on to the margins of this transcript, and on
		additional leaves. That transcript is preserved in the Bodleian library at
		Oxford, as MS Junius 12, and is the only source for parts of the Cotton copy
		which can no longer be read.</FONT></FONT> 
		<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="+1">Whether King Alfred was
		  really the author of the English translation has not yet been established with
		  certainty. The contemporary account of the king ascribed to Asser presents him
		  (though not consistently) as an earnest but ill-educated man who did not learn
		  Latin until he was about 38, some 12 or 13 years before his death, and one
		  might question whether such a person could really have mastered the complex
		  Latin of Boethius, especially the metres, and translated it so confidently,
		  particularly in the midst of major warfare which almost destroyed his kingdom.
		  There are, too, signs that whoever produced the Old English metrical version
		  did not have the kind of familiarity with the Latin text of Boethius and the
		  other sources used in the original translation which one might have expected if
		  he was the original translator - whether that was Alfred himself or someone
		  else. But the work certainly became well known in the next century.
		  &AElig;thelweard, the late tenth century ealdorman and chronicler, refers to it
		  as a much read work which moved its readers to tears, and &AElig;lfric the
		  homilist drew extensively upon it in his own writings. Leofric, the
		  eleventh-century bishop of Exeter, left a copy to his cathedral library, and
		  the work continued to attract interest through the twelfth and thirteenth
		  centuries.</FONT></FONT> </P>
