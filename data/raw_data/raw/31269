			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by <a href="http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/thebordercrossingobservatory/sara-maher/" target="_blank">Sara Maher</a>, </em><em>PhD student at Monash University and member of the <a href="http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/thebordercrossingobservatory/" target="_blank">Border Crossing Observatory</a>. She researches the impact of mass abduction and enslavement of South Sudanese borderlands women during the second Sudanese civil war (1983-2005). This post is part of the joint blog series on ‘Gender and Migration’ co-hosted by Border Criminologies and <a href="https://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">COMPAS</a>. Posts in this series will be published on both blogs every Friday until the end of June.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The precursor to my PhD research was an oral history project with South Sudanese Women elders. The <a href="http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/thebordercrossingobservatory/the-anyik%E1%BD%85%E1%BD%85l-project-launch-migrant-stories-from-south-sudanese-women/" target="_blank">Anyikool Project</a> collected over thirty hours of life stories and those recordings have now become part of the oral archive of the State Library of Victoria (Melbourne, Australia). The archive, in which women are vastly unrepresented, now includes African Australian women for the first time. The interviews will soon be made available online.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A knowledge of the recent history of South Sudan helps to contextualise these stories but this isn’t essential. All the interviews follow the same loose structure but vary greatly in content. The full spectrum of the class system is represented, from royal family to peasant farmers. About half of the participants had received some education and three had tertiary degrees. The women had been, in their former lives, farmers and teachers and nurses; a politician, a soldier, a businesswoman, and a development worker. Individually, the interviews are nuanced portraits, covering a wide range of experience, including migration to Australia. As a collection, the thirty plus hours bring to life the cultural diversity and the conflicts that are synonymous with southern Sudan in the mid to late twentieth century.</p>

Maher)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like South Sudan itself, the South Sudanese diaspora in Australia is extraordinarily diverse: culturally, linguistically, socially, and economically. They constitute Australia’s largest minority community—of a refugee background—roughly twenty-thousand of whom reside in Victoria. Participants in the Anyikool Project represented seven different ethnic groups: Kuku, Bari, Anyuak, Chollo, Nuer, Dinka, and Acholi. Multiple sub-groups exist within these ethnic groups, but all participants, other than Bari, originate from borderlands—the Acholi and Kuku with Uganda, the Anyuak with Ethiopia, and Chollo, Dinka, and Nuer on the northern border with Sudan. Women elders are a small percentage of the South Sudanese Australian diaspora and are rarely heard beyond their community for reasons of health and age, language barriers, and isolation, yet they maintain the oral traditions of their cultures. Their stories are compelling and evocative, conveying unique accounts of a period in their country’s history that includes the introduction of missionary-run Western-style education, the end of colonialsim, and the first civil war (1956-1972), as well as an array of cultural practices including marriage, food production, and family life.</p>

Maher) " width="590" height="389" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hannah Nyabiel Ponam – Nuer. “…life was always on the running” (Photo: S. Maher)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Powerful and often haunting accounts of the second civil war (1983-2005) provide new knowledge and understandings of the gendered violence these women suffered during that long war. Raids on their homes by government-backed militias, and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), forced vast numbers into destitution, impoverishment, and internal displacement, and to cross borders into neighbouring countries as refugees. Famine, disease, enslavement, and genocidal violence killed over two million people and displaced more than four million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the twenty-one years of conflict there were uncountable incidents of gendered violence. Stories of the war vary in perspective due to tribal and political affiliations but all of the women’s accounts embody survival in the face of extreme adversity. Women and children were targeted by militias and the SAF who avoided conflict with the rebel army, Sudanese Peoples Liberation Army (SPLA), and instead attacked unprotected villages with the express purpose of destroying families and livelihoods. Communities on the northern border between the Arab north and the African south were especially hard hit. The border is historically porous, contested, and hostile. For centuries African southerners have been abducted into slavery and trafficked across this border, a practice that had slowed by the end of British colonialism in the mid-1950s but remerged during the war. It has been claimed that between 1983 and 2002, up to 200,000 people, mainly women and children, were abducted and trafficked into rural and urban slavery in northern cities and neighbouring countries. It’s impossible to know how many remain enslaved. Such was the prevalence of slave trading almost all Anyikool Project participants; without prompting, many referred to or spoke of it directly. During one interview, the interpreter interjected and described their experience of being taken as a child during a raid and forced into slavery on a farm in the north until escaping months later.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sudan’s wartime borders were often natural barriers, changeable, unpredictable, some guarded, others not. The Kirr River in the province of the Bahr el-Ghazal separated southern Sudan from the north. The Gilo River in the Gambela district of Ethiopia was the border with Sudan. Thousands of women and children fleeing violence had no choice but to cross these rivers, made dangerous by deep, fast water, armed attacks and wild animals; rarely did the crossing of these rivers lead to safety.</p>
<div id="attachment_5700" style="width: 579px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-5700 size-full" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sudan3.jpg" alt="Nayanut Manyang Arop" width="569" height="438" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Nayanut Manyang Arop – Dinka. “….they kill the men and take women and girls&#8221; (Photo: S. Maher)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Those who travelled north did so believing falsely that they might find some protection in the so-called peace camps and shanties of Sudan’s capital, Khartoum. But first they had to safely cross the Kirr and make the long trek through Baggara territory with the risk of being killed, abducted, or raped by their militia. The alternative was to move east into Ethiopia via the Gilo River, another long and dangerous trek that could take months. Three refugee camps were created in Ethiopia from the mid-1980s: Dimma, Pinyudo, and Itang. Of the hundreds of thousands of refugees who filled those camps, approximately 27,000 were unaccompanied and orphaned children—a group that became known as the Lost Boys.</p>
<div id="attachment_5701" style="width: 583px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-5701 size-full" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sudan4.jpg" alt="Magret Nyapur Mamur " width="573" height="398" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Magret Nyapur Mamur – Chollo. “….we were never safe” (Photo: S. Maher)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the Mengistu government fell in 1991, those refugees were forced out of the camps back across the Gilo River by Ethiopian militias. A woman gave birth the night before the camp was attacked and put the newborn in a bucket, then the bucket on her head, and walked to the Gilo River with her two other small children. At the river she wove reeds into a basket, then put the children in it and crossed safely. A group of women pulled their children across in a fishing net at low tide. But many did not survive. Estimates of the number of fatalities at the Gilo River range from two to nine thousand. In most case they were children, drowned, eaten by crocodiles, or killed by militias.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The women conveyed these stories in a range of ways, including urgency, sadness, and nonchalance. One woman showed signs of traumatic distress and accepted a referral to a trauma agency. On the whole it seems that these women want to speak about that time. They remain silent only until they are asked. Being heard means their experiences are acknowledged. And that’s one of the purposes of the doctoral research the Anyikool Project led to. The other is to address the impact of slavery ten years after the war ended; to address social and cultural changes caused by the mass scale abductions. Questions are few in number and non-prescriptive, designed to encourage the orality of the participants. Fieldwork in Australia will begin in the coming weeks. Fieldwork in South Sudan will be conducted later this year. Despite a new life in a new country, South Sudanese Australians remain intensely connected to their homeland. While South Sudan achieved independence in 2011, the country hasn’t found stability or peace. A third civil war erupted in December 2013. Memories of the past had always been fresh and alive before this, but the latest conflict has torn open old wounds. All attempts to end the current conflict have failed, adding to the already profound sense of loss and injustice that already haunted the country and its diasporas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The women elders of South Sudan have much to offer in terms of discourses on wartime gendered violence, on trafficking and slavery, and border crossings—discourses that have historically excluded women’s stories. By engaging with indigenous knowledges, social science researchers can tap a vast wealth of experience and knowing. Methodologies that centre around orality can decolonise knowledge production and lead researchers into largely unexplored territory.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite El Salvador’s small size, more than 19,000 deported Salvadorans arrive from the US annually, and this number continues to grow (see Figure 1). <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/yearbook-immigration-statistics" target="_blank">According to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS)</a>, Salvadoran nationals are the fourth highest group of migrants detained in and deported from the US. These men and women often have lived in the US for years, and they may feel more at home there—as undocumented immigrants or temporary residents—than in El Salvador, which is their legal and native home.</p>
<div id="attachment_5593" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-5593 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/figure-300x224.png" alt="figure" width="300" height="224" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Created by author using data from the DHS (2014)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During Summer 2014, I spent a month speaking with deportees and their family members at El Salvador’s <em>Bienvenido a Casa </em>(Welcome Home) office, a government-sponsored program that greets deportees when they arrive from detention centers across the US. I followed up by undertaking 10 in-depth interviews with deported men. Their stories of detention, deportation, and reintegration reveal the challenges they face and their resistance to these injustices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Experiences of Immigrant Detention </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Salvadoran deportees recalled maltreatment in detention centers including low temperatures and limited food. In <em>hieleras</em> (iceboxes), air conditioning and fans blew cold air, while detainees were rarely given blankets or sweatshirts. One deportee remembered that the rooms were not only cold but also dirty and crowded. Detainees also reported being fed small, bland meals that left their stomachs grumbling: <em>‘The food is very poor and you go to sleep hungry and wake up hungry.’</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The Deportation Journey</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The journey from the US to El Salvador intensified deportees’ frustrations. They often arrived in El Salvador feeling dirty and uncomfortable. In the hours leading up to deportation, detainees were unable to shower, brush their teeth, or even use the bathroom privately. Some men recalled being unable to sleep because they were shackled at the hands, feet, and waist while kept in small cells, buses, or airplanes. While handcuffed, they were reminded on the airplane that, in case of emergencies, they would need to put on their oxygen masks, prompting the question: <em>‘How can I reach my hand to the oxygen? I can’t even reach my food to my mouth.’</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These examples show how detainees and deportees are disempowered by the US immigration system. They may encounter additional harassment and prejudice in El Salvador, where they’re mistaken for gang members or criminals—even though most Salvadoran deportees are removed for non-criminal reasons. This has prompted Pablo Alvarado to describe the deportation experience as a transfer ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HHBSHalcDk" target="_blank"><em>de un estado policial a otro estado policial</em></a>’ (from one police state to another).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Resistance in the Face of Injustice</em></strong></p>
<div id="attachment_5546" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5546" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/El-salvador-300x225.jpg" alt="El Salvador International (Photo: Mattos, 2012)" width="300" height="225" /><p class="wp-caption-text">El Salvador International (Photo: Mattos, 2012)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite these experiences and obstacles, deported Salvadorans found ways to maintain their dignity and resist injustice in detention centers, during deportation proceedings, and after returning to El Salvador. For example, one bilingual deportee recalls a moment when a security guard was repeatedly calling the name of one of the detainees with no response, because she’d been using the wrong accent and thus wasn’t understood. He remembers, <em>‘She said, “I&#8217;ve been calling and he&#8217;s stupid.’ I said, ‘No, he&#8217;s not stupid. He just doesn&#8217;t speak English, just like you don&#8217;t speak Spanish.” A lot of people with me couldn’t speak English, so they would ask for my help. Of course, I [helped]. If they needed an interpreter, I raised my hand. I always want to help.’</em> Another man would sing traditional folk songs in the detention centers to build morale, and still another participated in a hunger strike to change the center’s poor conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These men’s encounters with the US immigration enforcement regime clearly show the need for policy reform. However, they also remind us that humanity can prevail even in shackles.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Post by <a href="http://www.crim.ox.ac.uk/profile.php?who=mary.bosworth" target="_blank">Mary Bosworth</a>, Centre for Criminology, University of Oxford</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On Friday, 3 March 2015, I spent the day in Campsfield House Immigration Removal Centre. As usual I was based in the art room, observing and participating in the day’s activities. While much of it was spent watching men dress up for comic relief day (‘make your face funny for money’), near the end of the day I fell into conversation with a man, called Jay, whose pastel drawings had appeared since I was last in the centre. In his sketches and paintings Jay  represents a number of familiar themes of detention: struggle, freedom, memory, pain and motion. In so doing, he visually captures the pain of forced immobility, and demonstrates the power of art in generating understanding of this form of confinement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I asked Jay if I could write a post about his work for the blog and he generously agreed. He then took me around the room pointing to his artwork and explaining the messages he was trying to convey in them.</p>
<div id="attachment_5156" style="width: 220px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/parrot.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-5156 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/parrot-210x300.jpg" alt="Oil pastel. Parrot.  By Jay, IRC Campsfield House (Image: Immigration Detention Archive)" width="210" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Oil pastel, parrot, by Jay, IRC Campsfield House. (Image: Immigration Detention Archive)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘These pictures all come from my mind,’ he said. ‘That one,’ he gestured at the image below, which was pinned on the wall, ‘is about struggle. You have to be ready to fight to be free.’ The snake looms over the peacock, which is caught in its grip. Yet the bird has a sharp beak and is by no means defeated.</p>
<div id="attachment_5155" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/peacock1.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-5155 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/peacock1-300x219.jpg" alt="peacock" width="300" height="219" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Oil pastel, peacock and snake, by Jay, IRC Campsfield House. (Image: Immigration Detention Archive)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Further along the wall, Jay gestured to another of his pastels.  ‘This one,&#8217; he said, &#8216;this is like 3D. You see? The fish has some freedom, but it wants more. So it’s jumping out of the water.’ Uncomfortably large, relative to the small pool from which it has emerged, the gold fish is in motion, dripping with water, propelled into the air, as it looks for a bigger pond.</p>
<div id="attachment_5157" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/fishoutofwater.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-5157 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/fishoutofwater-300x183.jpg" alt="Oil pastel, fish by Jay IRC Campsfield House (Image: Immigration Detention Archive)" width="300" height="183" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Oil pastel, fish, by Jay, IRC Campsfield House. (Image: Immigration Detention Archive)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While most of Jay&#8217;s work was in oil pastels, he had completed one painting, which stood on the easel in the middle of the room.  A striking image of a veiled woman, it peered anxiously over the men at work.  Jay walked over to it.  ‘Did you see this painting?&#8217; he asked. &#8216;This is the first painting I ever did. I don’t know why but I was thinking about that picture of that Afghan girl. Do you remember her? With the strange eyes? On that magazine? That’s her. I only saw that photo once, but it stuck in my mind.’</p>
<div id="attachment_5158" style="width: 254px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/nationalgeographicpainting.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-5158 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/nationalgeographicpainting-244x300.jpg" alt="Acrylic paint, Veiled Afghan woman, by Jay, IRC Campsfield House (Image: Immigration Detention Archive)" width="244" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Acrylic paint, veiled Afghan woman, by Jay, IRC Campsfield House. (Image: Immigration Detention Archive)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A number of Jay’s sketches are quite disturbing. Taking up the familiar metaphor of the eye weeping blood, Jay offered two different versions of it. In the first, as in his image of the fish, the eyeball is bulging out of the picture. This grotesque and frightening image hints at untold trauma and rage.</p>
<div id="attachment_5159" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/weepingeye.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-5159 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/weepingeye-300x216.jpg" alt="Oil pastel image of weeping eye by Jay, IRC Campsfield House (Image: Immigration Detention Archive)" width="300" height="216" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Oil pastel, weeping eye, by Jay, IRC Campsfield House. (Image: Immigration Detention Archive)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the second, flatter image, the eye is once again weeping blood. This time, however, the pupil includes a face at its centre.</p>
<div id="attachment_5160" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/weepingwomeneye.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-5160 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/weepingwomeneye-300x206.jpg" alt="Oil pastel image of weeping by Jay, IRC Campsfield House (Image: Immigration Detention Archive)" width="300" height="206" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Oil pastel, weeping eye, by Jay, IRC Campsfield House. (Image: Immigration Detention Archive)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jay explained this picture to me. ‘You see this?’ he asked. ‘This is about detention. Everyone is crying here. Everyone is sad. Your eye is crying and when you look at someone else, you see in their eyes, that they are crying too. That is what I’m trying to show.’</p>
<div id="attachment_5161" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jay.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-5161 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jay-300x201.jpg" alt="Jay drawing 'Stop', IRC Campsfield House. (Image: Immigration Detention Archive)" width="300" height="201" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jay drawing &#8216;Stop&#8217; at IRC Campsfield House. (Image: Immigration Detention Archive)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just as I was about to leave for the day, Jay offered to make me a drawing to take back to Oxford to put in the physical collection of the <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/archiving-detention/" target="_blank">Immigration Detention Archive</a>. ‘I do this for you in five minutes,’ he promised, picking up charcoal confidently. ‘This picture, this is called “Stop.” It’s really just saying “stop” to all the bad things, you know, trafficking, detention. Bad things.’ Swiftly sketching a man, he then drew an oversized palm facing outwards, fingers outstretched.</p>
<div id="attachment_5176" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/sketching-detention-jays-story/jayfinalhand_2/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5176"><img class="wp-image-5176 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/JAYfinalhand_2-300x212.jpg" alt="JAYfinalhand_2" width="300" height="212" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Stop&#8221; by Jay, IRC Campsfield House (Image: Immigration Detention Archive)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although untrained and inexperienced in art, Jay was finding painting and drawing an unexpected pleasure in Campsfield House. The art room offered a means of expressing his (painful) emotions and (critical) beliefs. Painting and drawing were also new skills that he enjoyed exploring under guidance from the art teacher.  Not everyone feels able to experiment with new practices. In an environment of low trust, it’s risky to show your emotions in public. To do so through an unfamiliar medium like art, must be even more challenging. Yet, for Jay at least, some paper and a set of oil pastels had proven to be crucial in enduring this difficult time of his life.</p>

This post is part of the joint blog series on ‘Gender and Migration’ co-hosted by Border Criminologies and <a href="https://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">COMPAS</a>. Posts of this series will be published in both blogs <span style="text-decoration: underline;">every Friday</span> until the end of June.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Incorporating a feminist perspective, many community psychology scholars have stressed the importance of adopting a reflexive practice based on the sharing of how we conduct our work in different contexts with diverse participants/collaborators, and how our own personal histories, values, and social statuses have an impact on the research process and outcomes. As <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1005120001986" target="_blank">Mulvey and colleagues</a> highlight, these ‘messy accounts’ may help reveal whether and how our work is able to challenge power relations and inequalities, especially when we’re working with marginalized groups.</p>
<div id="attachment_4905" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/detention-1.png" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-4905 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/detention-1-300x225.png" alt="detention 1" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Detainees behind bar fences at Ponte Galeria, Rome’s Center for Identification and Expulsion (Photo: F.

<p style="text-align: justify;">For me, reflexivity has been a necessary tool to navigate the complexity of my <em>messy </em>research work within Ponte Galeria, Rome’s Center for Identification and Expulsion (CIE), the main migration-related detention center in Italy. The tensions and vulnerabilities I was experiencing began to acquire meaning, revealing of the research process and its intrinsic power imbalances. Messiness, which should not be associated with noise, as articulated recently by <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10464-014-9645-3" target="_blank">Edison Trickett and colleagues</a>, became a guideline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’ll always remember the feelings that arose the first time I entered Ponte Galeria. It was 2009, and I was working for <a href="http://www.befreecooperativa.org" target="_blank">BeFree Social Cooperative</a>, a feminist NGO in Rome engaged in combating violence against women. We were allowed into the CIE  to meet the migrant women held there and provide them with legal and psycho-social advice. I remember the large and rusty entry-gate as well as the many gates (physical and symbolic) I had to pass through… It was an emotionally taxing―but at the same time enriching―experience that indelibly marked me. It taught me that ‘sisterhood between women,’ an ideal very dear to me as a feminist, can be difficult to achieve when other salient identities, apart from gender, are at play. In the context of the CIE, my identity as a white, native, member of the dominant group was especially important.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some years later, I crossed that entry-gate again, as well as the many gates beyond it, this time as a doctoral student engaged in a research project on life in migration-related detention that seeks to document the noxious effects of such oppressive systems.</p>
<div id="attachment_4906" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/detention-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-4906 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/detention-2-300x225.jpg" alt="detention 2" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Main corridor of the female living unit at Ponte Galeria (Photo: F. Esposito)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite my professional background in the CIE, which has very much helped me to obtain research authorization and reduce the perception that I’m a ‘total outsider’ by the center staff, it hasn’t saved me from facing a variety of tensions and vulnerabilities. Staff members often look at me with suspicion and mistrust, making it hard to engage and work together. Yet, some members have been more open  than others, helping me ‘enter the field,’ becoming my gatekeepers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My insider/outsider status continuously shifts across time, space, and relationships.  My gender identity, age, and professional status  influence my positions within the research field as well as the relationships with different individuals and groups in the CIE. As a woman, I’m not allowed to access male areas without an escort of male security officers, being considered ‘vulnerable’ and ‘at risk.’ Like most detained women (except sex workers, Roma, and ex-prisoners who are considered to be ‘dangerous subjects’), I am ‘a potential victim’ and so ‘in need of protection.’ As <a href="http://www.palgrave-journals.com/fr/journal/v94/n1/abs/fr200944a.html" target="_blank">Gabriella Alberti</a> notes in relation to migrant women detained in Lesvos, Greece, ‘the regime of “gendered detention management”’ works to reproduce women’s vulnerability, while attempting to silence their voices as political subjects. My experience reveals the workings of this ‘technology of gender,’ using the words of <a href="http://books.google.it/books/about/Technologies_of_Gender.html?id=twvWBdWSTSMC&amp;redir_esc=y" target="_blank">Teresa De Lauretis</a>.  I have often been mistaken for a master&#8217;s student. Although irritating, such a ‘harmless status’, rendered even less alarming by my gender, set some staff, particularly security officers at ease, encouraging them to disclose  confidential and controversial information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My relationships with detained migrants are also personally challenging. My identity as a native-born Italian citizen, and my privileged status as member of the dominant group, has, at times, made it difficult to establish connections and relationships of trust. During the long conversations held in the ‘rooms’ or in the corridors of the CIE, migrants’ discussions frequently addressed the ‘<em>injustice of being confined just for their migrant status</em>,’ including me in the group of the oppressors, the Italians, who made them suffer ‘<em>due to racism and xenophobia</em>.’ ‘<em>Italy wicked! This place is no good!</em>’ a Nigerian woman once shouted at me, it’s ‘<em>because we are black, that’s</em> <em>why Italian treat us like this! Like animals!</em>.’ It’s not easy to deal with the anger, frustration, and distress of people who identify you with the dominant group responsible for their suffering. It&#8217;s also not easy to overcome their diffidence and mistrust―the main emotional dimensions within the CIE―and to build collaborative and open relationships. A key, resonating questions is <em>Why should you be different?</em> It’s been hard for me to accept this accusation, especially from detained women, as I had hoped that sharing the same gender identity, would enable empathy and reciprocity . With male detainees instead, apart from the constraints imposed by my reduced mobility in their areas and the challenges also faced with women, the main difficulty relates to their use of masculine power to challenge our relationship.</p>
<div id="attachment_4907" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/detention-3.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-4907 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/detention-3-225x300.jpg" alt="detention 3" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lateral corridor of the female living unit at Ponte Galeria (Photo: F. Esposito)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’ve found that by being open, authentic, and honest about my experiences and identities, as well as about my research goals, it’s been possible to establish meaningful relationship with many of those locked up. Some wanted to know more about me to decide if and how to disclose information about themselves. In other words, they wanted trust in exchange for trust. Women often asked if I was married, if I had children, where I was living. Sharing my experiences, including migratory ones (I lived in London for almost a year and now I reside in Lisbon), and my struggles helped establish connections. Many were familiar with Lisbon and Portugal, having passed through there for several reasons; the evocation of those places reminded them of moments of freedom and happiness. A Roma woman asked me, for instance, if and when I could go to Fatima’s sanctuary in Portugal, to light a candle for her to have other children. More practically, I also shared  information about rights, laws, procedures, strategies, and advocacy services available inside the CIE. Indeed, many detainees lacked this essential information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During this process, which is ongoing, some relationships became so strong that they continue after detention. I’m still in contact with many men and women who keep me informed about their lives. New technologies help: Facebook and WhatsApp make it easier to share information regardless of where we are in the world. I communicate with those who are still detained over the phone  or via text message. (Unfortunately, there are no internet connections or computers available inside the CIE.) Some detainees/ex-detainees have become long-term participants, actively involved in the development of the research.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the oppressive context of the CIE, I have learned that by being an <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FB%3AAJCP.0000014316.27091.e8" target="_blank">honest and passionate witness</a>, it’s possible to create meaningful human relationships. Even so, it’s necessary to engage in an ongoing exercise of reflexivity, to continuously reexamine and reposition myself and become more sensitive and able to navigate power differentials endemic in research relationships, especially in sites of confinement like this one. Fieldwork is messy and personal, hence, as feminists argue, political.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Forced return in Sweden is characterized by heavy politicization, systemic fragmentation and is shrouded in a veil of securitization. Forced return is both an organized activity, with different state and non-state authorities involved, and an activity that seeks to end a relationship of responsibility between the state and the non-citizen. The forced return migration process is generally not conceptualised as a comprehensive process by policy-makers or practitioners but rather as a loosely linked series of activities that eventually lead to the return of the migrant. This is possibly due to the disparate institutional actors involved. For migrants however, the actual “end threat” of removal to their country of origin is very real and hangs like a dark shadow on their existence for as long as they hold temporary permits of residence. This dark shadow of deportation takes on new and tangible proportions through the institutional forms and practices that migrants, who have either failed their application for asylum or who have no other lawful permit to remain in the country, encounter. Our project attempts to start filling a knowledge gap by exploring migrants’ own experiences of this particular forced return process conceptualised as a social, cultural and political phenomenon. Access and contact with migrants is therefore of utmost importance to our project.</p>
<div id="attachment_4759" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-4759 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1017-300x95.jpg" alt="IMG_1017" width="300" height="95" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Migrant Detention Centre, Kållered</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original plan at the start of this 18-month project was to first obtain access to one or more of Sweden’s five immigration detention centres where we would spend time, through regular visits, with migrants at risk of deportation. This would have enabled regular contact with migrants since we were aware that meeting migrants at risk of deportation out in the community would be very difficult. Indeed, as our own study came to confirm, in Sweden migrants at risk of deportation out in the community are difficult to identify since they (understandably) do not share widely their legal status, partly to avoid stigma, but mostly because it increases their precariousness in various settings. We now know that migrants, particularly those who do not opt for voluntary return, take time to or even refuse to consider the real eventuality of return, and therefore would also not identify themselves as potential deportees.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second part of our original strategy was to seek the collaboration of entities who are regularly in touch with migrants at risk of deportation―institutional entities such as the police, non-governmental organisations who offer services to migrants, including those at risk of deportation, and activist organisations whom migrants contact for help usually as a last resort. This strategy would have neatly given us several points of access and contact with migrants, it would have allowed us to carry out ethnographic research in various settings and sites, and would therefore have made it possible for us to capture elements and patterns in migrants’ experiences of forced return.</p>
<div id="attachment_4760" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-4760 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1660-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_1660" width="300" height="225" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Migrant Detention Centre, Åstorp</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, neat strategies on paper seldom work out as planned in irregular migrant settings, and ours was no exception. As a research group, and based on our previous experiences in conducting research with migrants, we expected challenges but thought we were well-prepared. We had spent time discussing alternative strategies, and possible problems that could arise from institutions who fear scrutiny. So how did we end up in a situation, which could possibly only be described as “internalized stalemate”? In other words, why did we―the researchers―ended up in a situation where we felt immobilized, afraid to take initiative and under attack from every angle? What was the cause of our troubles? And how could we minimize the impact that these struggles are bound to have on the research that we were conducting, and on the production of knowledge?</p>
<div id="attachment_4761" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1019.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4761 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1019-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_1019" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Visiting room, Migrant Detention Centre, Kållered</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The simplest answer to the above questions is that we, both as researchers and persons, were often caught in crossfire(s). The highly politicized nature of the field, broadly understood as the various institutions, service/providers and NGOs, meant that we were questioned and subject to scrutiny ourselves not just as researchers but also from a moral aspect, as persons. The field is imbued with front lines. One of the most apparent is the contrasting ideologies. For example, authorities, such as the Border Police and the Migration Board (responsible for running detention centres) have very little in common with activist networks. Differences in ideology, morality and political tendencies were evidenced in the use of different terminology. As researchers one of our first hurdles was to learn how to navigate these different language/terminology-groups in an attempt to avoid being labelled. At a later stage we were familiar enough with the different terminologies to use them intentionally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Surprisingly although the entities we encountered in the beginning of our project were of a very different nature, we were often met with similar responses. For example, many times our phone calls and e-mails were met with silence and no replies. We found it hard to interpret the lack of communication: was it due to lack of time, or did they simply not want to be in touch with us, and if so, why was this? Persistence is one of the sacred traits of researchers. But when we did manage to get in touch we often found that the interactions were imbued with suspicion and distrust, at times leading to sudden changes in their attitudes, which we found hard to understand. A classic example was when we established what we thought was a clear contact and an uncomplicated interaction, with one of the gatekeeper institutions, which would enable us to obtain regular contact with migrants. The tables turned very quickly when someone in the institution requested our original research plan. We were then denied access for “having too many faults and unclarities in our research plan.” The communication with us was stopped and the institution contacted the funding agency with the complaints. Complaints which were ambiguous and far from clear to say the least. Various attempts were made by us and by the funding agency (which is also a government entity) to try to get to the bottom of this, in a genuine bid to understand the problem. After several unsuccessful efforts to establish dialogue over a six week period we decided to drop it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" size-full wp-image-4743 alignleft" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/EuropeanREtunrFund.jpg" alt="EuropeanREtunrFund" width="263" height="237" />Another example of being met with distrust and suspicion came from the NGO side, where we had some prior contacts and had established, again what we thought was, a good relationship. In fact we were invited to spend time in their facilities, which migrants use to relax and to get in touch with the NGO for help. In this case we were wrongly accused of omitting information about where the funding was coming from. The European Return Fund is linked to the EU Return Directive and this civil organisation had a strong ideological position against both. Accusations flew high and low. Our morality and integrity as researchers and persons were put into question. Attempts to break through this impasse left us in a state of frustration, despair and confusion. It seemed impossible for anyone to understand that we genuinely wanted to understand how migrants experience the forced return process. We did not have ulterior political motives and did not want to align ourselves with any of the actors. Irrespective of this we were constantly labelled, re-labelled, positioned and re-positioned by the different actors themselves. The common motive, or least outcome of this, was that we were excluded from the field and contact with migrants was made directly or indirectly extremely difficult.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rays of light kept us going in the difficult periods. We had a few contacts, often individual and undercover, who were extremely helpful. Slowly new doors opened here and there as people of different affiliations and institutions agreed to help us in significant ways. Although to be honest, it was and still is, quite hard to really understand why some contacts worked and others did not.  A possible explanation in our attempts to understand and make sense of our interactions with different gatekeepers or middlemen are Bourdieu’s concepts of the ‘field’ and ‘symbolic capital.’ This field of activity of deportation is clearly not homogenous, and practices that are connected to different fields (bureaucracies such as the police and the Migration Board, activist groups, voluntary organisations) have their own separate rules of access and power structures. The researcher thus requires different symbolic capital to gain trust and legitimacy in these different fields. From this point of view, although this of course is only a part explanation of what was going on, we, the three researchers, lacked enough symbolic capital in these different gatekeeping fields to enable us to access them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are aware that our frustration is coming from trying to establish contact or fruitful interaction with gatekeepers, when the people we really wanted to meet, the migrants, were ironically the easiest to speak to. Reaching the migrants meant that we needed to change our original strategy. We worked hard with the principle of “the strength of weak ties” made popular by several anthropologists and social network analysts, and we spent time at places that accommodate migrants at risk of deportation and circulated information posters about the project. Needless to say, trying to map the field and getting in touch with migrants was an extremely time consuming, tedious and gruelling business. In itself however, and this is where methodological self-reflexivity for the researcher turned out to be critical for our project, we did gain a lot of insights about the institutional and political forces that shape this field. We also understood that, when doing research in a field like this, the way researchers are perceived by others may have little to do what they actually say or do, and that researchers may have few or no real means to control this process.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Post by Mary Bosworth, Centre for Criminology, University of Oxford</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For some years now, I have been conducting research in British immigration removal centres (IRCs) using a range of methods. IRCs are particularly challenging research environments, both because of the extreme anxiety suffered by many detainees and because research access is closely guarded by the state and the private companies who run them. Under these circumstances it has been important to develop a range of methods to understand these sites better and to ensure we can communicate the research findings with a wide range of audiences. Whereas in the creation of the <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/archiving-detention/" target="_blank">Immigration Detention Archive</a> I am using visual methods, alongside observation and unstructured interviews, such qualitative methods are of limited use to policy makers who require larger, more representative, statistical data. It is here, that the <em>Measure of the Quality of Life in Detention</em> (MQLD) has been most effective and has the greatest potential for effecting change. Not only does it enable researchers to gather the viewpoints of a large group of immigration detainees, but its quantitative nature mean that its results can be shared with and used by policy makers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the <em>Measure of the Quality of Prison Life</em> (MQPL), developed by Professor Alison Liebling at the University of Cambridge and administered by HM Prison Service, on which it is modeled, the MQLD has been developed specifically for understanding the characteristics, needs and experiences of immigration detainees with a view to improving detention conditions and policy. It is made up of three parts. The first gathers self-report demographic data including: citizenship, immigration status, information about former periods in custody, marital and family status. The second section concentrates on their health needs, with particular attention to suicide and self-harm. It includes an abbreviated form of the Hopkins Trauma Scale (HSCL-D) measuring depression. The third and final section addresses quality of life.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">‘Quality of life’ is a broad ranging concept that connects health, relationships, autonomy, personal beliefs and legitimacy, to salient features of the environment in which people live. It includes people’s general physical, mental and social wellbeing, and their sense of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the conditions in which they are living relative to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns. People’s assessment of their current quality of life will be shaped by their previous experiences and their sense of self. Using a likert-type scale the MQLD asks respondents to agree or disagree with 53 statements, measuring their perceptions of the justice, fairness, safety and legitimacy of their treatment. This final section includes some space for them to offer additional free text comments about their experience of detention.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The survey was applied in a range of IRCs since September 2013, by postdoctoral research fellow Dr Sarah Turnbull and by psychology Lecturer Dr Blerina Kellezi from the University of Staffordshire. The results were then written up into a report which is now <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MQLD.pdf" target="_blank">available to download</a>. Below, I summarise the report’s main findings. Based on these findings, we are continuing to adjust the survey, in preparation for another round of systematic application, across six additional sites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Part One of the Survey: Demographics and Depression</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The report is based on 213 surveys. The men and women in detention who completed the questionnaire came from a variety of countries and presented with a range of family, legal and medical histories. Some of them reported that they participated in activities in the centre, but quite a few others found being in detention very difficult and could not take part in any of the activities on offer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The level of depression among the surveyed population was very high with four-fifths of the respondents, 80.4% (n=176), meeting the criteria for depression using the abbreviated form of the HSCL-D. This result reflects similar findings in other jurisdictions, e.g. with detainees in Norway and with former detainees in Australia as well as with our previous research in 2012 (<a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/finalmqld.pdf" target="_blank">Bosworth and Kellezi, 2012</a>).</p>
<div id="attachment_4647" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-4647 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0118-300x201.jpg" alt="DSC_0118" width="300" height="201" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The chapel at Colnbrook IRC. (Photo: Immigration Detention Archive, Border Criminologies)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Those who were more depressed were: women, had health problems and were taking medication, had not lived long in the UK, had not been in prison prior to detention, had applied for asylum (up to 2 times), and/or had applied for judicial review. Those who were depressed had also specific experiences in that particular IRC: they were more likely to have participated in a fluid or food refusal, to have been placed on an ACDT (Assessment Care in Detention and Teamwork) plan, to have used interpreters, and to have been longer in detention. They did not use activities like the gym, or religious services, did not report staff or the IT room or library as positive aspects of detention, and spent less time reading. They were also more likely to report that immigration detention was unjust.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were no significant differences between the overall scores (means) of depression among the four removal centres. Although women were more depressed, the surveys in Yarl’s Wood included a number of men and the comparison includes the overall scores for each centre. Overall, there were no significant differences between Yarl’s Wood depression mean scores and those from the other centres.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Notwithstanding such high rates of depression on the HSCL-D scale, the current ACDT plan did not extend to all participants who reported that they were thinking about suicide ‘quite a bit’ or ‘extremely.’ This gap could reflect communication barriers between staff and detainees or it could signal a lack of trust and willingness on the side of detainees in reporting this information to centre staff. The men and women who took part in the survey reported a number of physical and additional psychological problems in addition to depression.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When participants were asked to report negative aspects of detention, their responses focused on the restrictions inherent in detention, the food and other conditions in the centres, separation from their families, centre staff, and their deportation or immigration case. Many, quite simply, believed detention to be unjust. When participants were asked to report positive aspects about the particular IRC they identified socialising with other detainees, positive personal growth, religion, staff members and a number of centre activities. All the positive and negative aspects of detention that the participants identified without prompting are also currently measured in the MQLD questionnaire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong><strong>Part Two of the Survey: Quality of Life in Detention (MQLD)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‪The second part of the questionnaire measures detainees’ views of the ‘quality of life’ in their current detention centre. In line with other measures such as the MQPL and the The World Health Organization Quality of Life Survey (WHOQOL) the ‘quality of life’ refers to people’s general physical, mental and social wellbeing, and their sense of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the conditions in which they are living relative to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns. It is a broad ranging concept that connects health, relationships, autonomy, personal beliefs and legitimacy, to salient features of the environment in which people live.</p>
<div id="attachment_3992" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DSC_0017.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3992 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DSC_0017-300x200.jpg" alt="Art room Campsfield House (Photo: S. Turnbull)" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The arts and crafts room in Campsfield House IRC. (Photo: S. Turnbull)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, the survey suggested that detainees were broadly dissatisfied with their quality of life in the four IRCs, although on each dimension a sizeable proportion neither agreed nor disagreed, suggesting some level of ambivalence. There was some variation in results among the centres and between the dimensions. Within the dimensions as well, certain issues tended to attract more negative or positive viewpoints than others. These variations point to the utility of the survey and also identify areas for future research and policy action.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dimension on which the most sizeable minority of detainees recorded levels of satisfaction related to staff decency, with 40% of respondents across the board agreeing that officers were reasonable and appropriate. Close behind, 37% of detainees agreed that the centres were safe. The same proportion (i.e., 37%) also agreed that detainees had agency and self-determination, suggesting that respondents felt able to communicate and make decisions for themselves (communication and autonomy dimension).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, 41% of detainees in this sample reported that they did not feel that the IRC in which they were held was characterised by kind regard and concern for the person that recognised their value and humanity as an individual. This dimension on ‘dignity,’ points to a sizeable legitimacy deficit among the confined. As we found in the previous application of the survey, immigration staff tended to be viewed more negatively than custodial staff. Thus, 40% of detainees did not feel that immigration officers were impartial or legitimate (immigration procedural fairness dimension). The same proportion (i.e., 40%) also did not believe the immigration system was clear, predictable or reliable (immigration organisation and consistency dimension).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Higher depression scores on the HSCL-D were related to more negative evaluations of a number of dimensions on the MQLD. Essentially those who were more depressed tended to rate lower (i.e., to dispute the presence of) dignity, safety, staff decency, immigration organisation and consistency, immigration procedural fairness, communication and autonomy, healthcare, care for vulnerable, and staff help and assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were some differences among the centres on certain dimensions. Overall, residents in Campsfield House were more positive about all aspects of their quality of life in detention measured by MQLD. The differences were statistically significant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In all centres, detainees who had applied for asylum had lower mean scores for (i.e., were more negative about) the dimensions measuring immigration procedural fairness and communication and autonomy. Those who had used interpreters or translation services in the centre and thus were likely to speak less English, had lower mean scores for (i.e., were more negative about) dimensions measuring healthcare, dignity, immigration organisational consistency, communication and autonomy. They were also more distressed. Those who reported having health problems had lower mean scores for (i.e., were more negative about) healthcare, dignity, immigration procedural fairness. They were also more distressed. And finally, those who had stayed longer in detention had lower mean scores for (i.e., were more negative about) healthcare, dignity, safety, staff decency, immigration procedural fairness, communication and autonomy, care for the vulnerable and staff help. They were also more distressed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since one centre is primarily for women and three for men, when comparing Yarl’s Wood to Campsfield House, Colnbrook and Dover it is not possible to conclude which of the differences in perception is due to gender or which is a result of different regimes/practices in the IRCs. Although the Yarl’s Wood sample included a number of men, it is again not possible to conclude which of the differences are due to being in a mixed environment or which result from the different regimes/practices in the IRCS.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The survey uncovered some differences in detainee perceptions of the centres on specific parameters as well as some absolute differences between the centres. Those in Campsfield House were more positive about their quality of life in detention than detainees were about the other three centres. In all centres, asylum seekers (who had applied for asylum up to two times) had higher levels of depression. Those who did not leave their rooms were also more likely to be distressed, and women overall had higher levels of depression. Those who had been detained for longer were also more likely to be depressed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The survey found that detainees differentiated between custodial staff and immigration staff, trusting the former more than the latter, while uncovering a worrying gap between those detainees who had been placed on an ACDT relative to the numbers who reported suicidal thoughts on the HSCL-D. All of these issues were also identified when an earlier version of the survey was previously administered in 2012 (<a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/finalmqld.pdf" target="_blank">Bosworth and Kellezi, 2012</a>).</p>
<div id="attachment_4648" style="width: 211px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-4648 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0052-201x300.jpg" alt="DSC_0052" width="201" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The sports hall, Colnbrook IRC.

<p style="text-align: justify;">A number of attempts were made to develop dimensions on regime, preparation for release and uncertainty. Regime is an essential dimension in the MQPL prison survey but it has not been possible, thus far, to replicate a similar measure in detention. This is partly due to the different nature and purpose of the regime in IRCs but also may be a result of the high turnover and unpredictable nature of detention. During the qualitative work we found that detainees were preoccupied with their return to their country of origin. Previous versions of the survey tried to measure attempts to prepare detainees for their return to country of origin. However, we found that the vast majority of detainees could not identify any attempts to prepare them for life after release or could not understand the questions. Finally, another important issue identified during the qualitative work that we have not yet been able to develop an adequate measure of is uncertainty. Because it is so prevalent, it is difficult to develop a dimension that measures it meaningfully.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The issues faced by the men and women in detention are complex and need to be understood in more depth. This survey attempts to gather information on their needs and experiences in a systematic fashion. Low levels of trust and high levels of depression, alongside language barriers and varying times in detention present significant challenges to administering a survey of this nature. The largest sample gathered over the shortest period of time occurred at Dover, where men were offered £5 telephone top ups to participate.</p>
<p>More work needs to be done on obtaining a random sample and on including non-English speakers. Dimensions on regime, preparation for release and uncertainty also need to be expanded. Based on these findings we have adjusted the MQLD, and hope to start administering it for a third time later this year.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/people/anatstasiatataryn/" target="_blank">Anastasia Tataryn</a>, Postdoctoral Teaching Fellow at the <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/" target="_blank">Warwick Law School</a>. Anastasia&#8217;s work is focused on transnational labour migration: immigration law, labour and employment law, particularly with regards to precarious work in the UK. Her PhD thesis questions how and why political reactions and media attention to immigration obscures realities and induces fears about work and employment. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over recent months, debates over immigration in the United Kingdom reveal a <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/11/new-politics-how-old-political-consensus-melting-away" target="_blank">new phase of politics</a> for the Conservative/Liberal Democratic Coalition and the opposition Labour party. The current vehemence about the presence of foreigners is commonly attributed to the rise in popularity and prominence of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP). UKIP’s anti-Europe and anti-immigrant stance depends on popular scare-mongering that disproportionately blames non-British workers and racially-identified populations for everything from shifting labour market demands to <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/getting-tough-nhs/" target="_blank">National Health Service (NHS) wait times</a> and motor vehicle <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/07/nigel-farage-blames-immigration-m4-traffic-ukip-reception" target="_blank">traffic</a>. UKIP’s leader Nigel Farage represents a wave of populism and protectionism that&#8217;s common not only in the United Kingdom but throughout Europe as well as North America. However, the UK political parties (Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Labour) have seized UKIP’s bait and political debates are largely driven by the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/26/michael-fallon-comments-tories-disarray" target="_blank">UKIP agenda</a>. Consequently, the ‘immigration debate’ is not a true debate at all. ‘Immigration’ is a flame that&#8217;s being fanned on a daily basis through the sensationalized, hyperbolized, and reactionary political discussions featured in British media.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/british-workers.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4452" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/british-workers-300x188.jpg" alt="british workers" width="300" height="188" /></a>Some argue that the reactions to immigration are unrelated to real economic fears, but rather spring from anxieties about<a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/11/open-letter-cameron-should-write-immigration" target="_blank"> cultural change</a>. Economic data from the <a href="http://www.cream-migration.org/" target="_blank">Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration</a> (CReAM) at the University College London <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1114/051114-economic-impact-EU-immigration" target="_blank">published</a> on 4 November 2014, for instance, demonstrate that immigrants from the European Economic Area (EEA) have continuously made a positive fiscal contribution to the British economy (see coverage in the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11209234/Immigration-from-outside-Europe-cost-120-billion.html" target="_blank">Telegraph</a> versus the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/05/eu-migrants-uk-gains-20bn-ucl-study" target="_blank">Guardian</a>). Nevertheless, political discussions and media remain focused on racially/ethnically defined foreigners—for instance, Eastern European workers, but without specifying who&#8217;s from with the EEA and who&#8217;s outside the EEA—as if they were firstly, taking British jobs away from British workers, and secondly, taking advantage of the social welfare system and <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10996721/David-Cameron-announces-immigration-benefits-crackdown.html" target="_blank">draining the NHS budget</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/newspapers.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-4453 alignleft" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/newspapers.jpg" alt="newspapers" width="275" height="183" /></a>The label ‘migrant’ suggests not only a temporary status. These individuals are also often believed to consent to work in low-waged, low-skilled, and precarious work because they&#8217;re usually from less developed countries. Thus, their exploitable and degraded status is justified in relation to what conditions they might have been facing in employment in their countries of origin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my PhD work, I began thinking about immigration and migrant labour in the UK through concerns about the label ‘irregular migrant labour’ (IML). IML was used in <a href="http://www.ippr.org/publications/no-easy-options-irregular-immigration-in-the-uk" target="_blank">policy reports</a>, <a href="http://www.iom.int/cms/en/sites/iom/home/about-migration/key-migration-terms-1.html#Irregular-migration" target="_blank">international labour and migration information</a>, and <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/immigration/irregular-immigration/index_en.htm" target="_blank">EU policy discussions</a> on border control. The term ‘irregular migrant’ gained popularity, although IML remains an ambiguous term that is not clearly defined. It suggests a demographic of workers who are not-regular and non-citizens, yet the people referred to through this label are not clearly undocumented (‘illegal’). The label exemplifies the precarious situation of persons who are not included as regular workers or employees in a standard employment relationship in the labour market, but who are not nationals in their country of work. These persons are considered to be ‘migrant,’ which in spite of holding a valid work permit or having the right to free movement of labour within the EU, can mean that they&#8217;re racially and ethnically singled out as being ‘non-British’ foreigners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Identifying how and why this label was used, it became evident that the situation of IML, while commonly addressed in immigration discussions, isn&#8217;t simply a consequence of immigration law and policy. Rather, the demand for low-waged, bottom-end (exploitable) workers in precarious employment conditions was driving a labour force from across Europe and within the UK into ‘irregular’ labour. Furthermore, both immigration and labour/employment laws, permit IML to persist. The label of ‘irregular’ points to these persons existing in legal grey areas. These legal grey areas are the shadows, the gaps, in the law, where immigration and labour/employment laws are built on predetermined categories that identify how persons are included and excluded as they live, work, and participate in an economy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, as Bridget Anderson suggests in her 2013 book <em><a href="https://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/research/citizenship/us-and-them/" target="_blank">Us &amp; Them</a></em>, this inclusion and exclusion is based on individuals’ conformity with socially and morally established behaviours enshrined in the nation-state. The nation-state, as a governing structure and bureaucracy, doesn&#8217;t determine the limits of acceptable behaviour. Rather, social, historical, and economic market (ideological) values have developed into a regulatory ‘community of value’ that elusively regulate membership based on ideal conditions of desirability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/police.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4454" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/police-300x223.jpg" alt="police" width="300" height="223" /></a>A political-juridical-ecotechnical approach to immigration and labour draws on <a href="http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-luc-nancy/biography/" target="_blank">Jean-Luc Nancy</a>’s philosophy as a fundamental ontological questioning. Nancy’s work disrupts traditional Western philosophical thinking and offers an alternative thinking that exposes the intersection of immigration concerns, labour market demands, cultural fears and ideas of citizenship, and economic participation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This approach critiques the order and system of governance that has created, and depends on, a politically identified category of workers as irregular, migrant, labourers. Notions of who is regular and who is irregular are based on historically specific power hierarchies that are reliant on a particular understanding of being from a nexus of citizenship/subject/community/sovereignty. Through the elusive category of IML, the excess of nation-state-centred categories are written into the dominant ideology. Yet IML is only included as excluded. The regular citizen labourer, the reverse of IML, is based on points of reference that have been made to seem as if they were necessary and natural. However, they are the product of historically specific ideologies, namely the nation-state and market economic system. For instance, the ideology of the globalized market economy is seen to be the only possibility of economic growth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My methodology is, firstly, political, in the sense of considering the political discourses that identify immigration as a problem affecting labour market participation. I map these discourses onto questions about the meaning and significance of citizenship. I engage with scholarship and critical theory in order to think of migration and labour from the point of view of ‘radical change.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly, my methodology is juridical, when I question the application of legal rights frameworks for IML. Furthermore, law, as a practice and as an idea supports identity as a legal subjectivity. I explore law through Nancy’s work, where law is both juridical and existential. Law is instrumentalised as a tool of the nation-state, embedded in a market economic ideology, where law maintains persons in legal grey areas (as irregular). Immigration law and labour law enact both juridical and existential law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, my approach is eco-technical. Eco-technics, in Nancy’s work, links the eco, home, household (from οίκος, meaning ‘house’), with technē (from τέχνη, meaning ‘craft’ or ‘art’). The technical structure that orders and ‘makes sense of’ the interruptive, incoherent, and incommensurable (often ‘law’ refers to this technical practice, technique of order). Eco-technics assumes both nature and technology when it refers to the capital circulation in the world that effects the circulation of sense in the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A political-juridical-ecotechnical approach to IML involves thinking of (a) the technical circulation of capital and exchange known through the market economy, and (b) the intersections of beings—people, bodies, interacting and forming labour or community relationships—beyond technical, predetermined, categories. The need to engage in such a ‘fundamental ontological questioning’ comes from the need to think differently in order to address the current experiences of vulnerability and marginalisation in work and citizenship and to bring sense to the hyperbolised, sensationalized and reactionary discussions currently dominating immigration and labour debates in the UK.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by <a href="http://glasgow.academia.edu/AnnaBeesley" target="_blank">Anna Beesley</a>, PhD Candidate in Social Anthropology, <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk" target="_blank">University of Glasgow</a>. Anna previously worked for <a href="http://sdv.org.uk" target="_blank">Scottish Detainee Visitors</a>, a small charity based in Glasgow that supports immigration detainees in <a href="http://www.geogroup.co.uk/dungavel-house-irc" target="_blank">Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre</a>. She currently sits on its committee and coordinates the Scottish Detention Forum. In this post, she draws on her on-going ethnographic research into mental distress in the UK asylum system that she is conducting as a doctoral student.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Issues around disclosure have emerged in various ways throughout my PhD research in which I concentrate on the people, systems, connections, and relationships at play, in order to gain a better understanding of mental distress in the asylum system. For asylum applicants, their very existence within the system is inextricably linked to their disclosure of intimate information to the Home Office, solicitors and often many other agencies. In my study, I’m widening the focus to the lived experiences of the various actors involved in the asylum process from asylum applicants to the Home Office caseworkers, including the service providers, campaigners, lawyers, and medics in between.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m curious as to what, how, and to whom people disclose their cases (either voluntarily or involuntarily) as well as what remains hidden. I’m also exploring how the (potentially distressing) content of what is disclosed permeates throughout and affects the webs of relationships that make up the asylum system. I’m interested in how and to whom actors listen and respond. In this post, I reflect upon one example of disclosure within the UK asylum system through a story of a woman I know.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Wenda</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_4354" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/06/asylum-seekers-azure-card" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-4354 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/card-300x180.jpg" alt="Azure payment card" width="300" height="180" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image taken from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/06/asylum-seekers-azure-card" target="_blank">The Guardian</a></p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘Wenda’ is 29 years old and from Zimbabwe. She has two children under the age of eight. They all lived in the asylum system for six years before recently being granted discretionary leave to remain. These years were stressful. Wenda and her kids were troubled with having their claim refused, having to go to court for appeals, and trying to exist on the government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/asylum-support/overview" target="_blank">Section 4 support</a>. This consists of accommodation on a ‘no choice’ basis, and subsistence support of £35.39 a week via the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/351369/Azure_Card_Carrier_2014.pdf" target="_blank">Azure payment card</a>, which can only be used in designated supermarkets and restricts the purchasing of certain items such as alcohol and tobacco. This system the <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmhaff/71/71vw32008_HC71_01_VIRT_HomeAffairs_ASY-34.htm" target="_blank">Home Affairs Select Committee</a> found to ‘cause unnecessary emotional and physical difficulties for asylum seekers’ (April, 2013). A similar system is being <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29414565" target="_blank">currently considered</a> by the Coalition government to control the spending power of other ‘untrustworthy’ categories (e.g., people with addiction problems) who receive mainstream benefits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Forced Disclosure</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People in the asylum process are not allowed to work. For Wenda, this restriction meant surviving on the £35.39 a week uploaded to her Azure card. The amount of money is minimal, but for Wenda the greatest struggle, which others have also <a href="www.cityofsanctuary.org/files/azure_card_report_2014_final_proof_1.pdf" target="_blank">documented</a>, was that she had no access to cash. She couldn’t give her children pocket money so they could be ‘like the other kids at school.’ A report on the effects of the Azure Card by the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/234776188/Azure-Card-Report-2014" target="_blank">British Red Cross</a> found that for people on this type of support getting to essential appointments is hugely problematic. This aspect also troubled Wenda. In order to travel around the city, she had to present evidence of an appointment (for example, with her lawyer or doctor) either to her housing provider or a charity such as her local integration network. These organisations would then arrange a taxi for her or provide a one-day travel pass.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every fortnight, Wenda and her children attended a counselling session at a medical organisation that provides specialist services for people who have experienced torture. Many of the services offered to people who have suffered torture, or who have specific medical conditions such as HIV, can be identified through the organisations’ names. Whilst on Section 4 support, Wenda needed to present documentary evidence of her appointment in order to access transport to get there. This system of support required Wenda to disclose to the third party that paid for her travel both her whereabouts and information about her previous intimate experiences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Spaces of Resistance</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By no means do I wish to paint the somewhat familiar picture of a passive, suffering immigrant. Wenda is resilient. She employed coping mechanisms that contributed to the disruption of the structure under which she lived, the details of which, I have chosen not to disclose. Nonetheless, in order to resist in this way Wenda was often required to disclose to people in her social network the fact that she is in the asylum process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/asylum-applicant.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4470 " src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/asylum-applicant-292x300.jpg" alt="asylum applicant" width="356" height="365" /></a>The Inequality of Choice</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wenda’s story typifies the experiences of many women, men and children whose everyday lives are under the control of UK immigration powers. Her experience reveals the inequality of choice that surrounds disclosure for some people. In order to access certain services she has little option but to disclose personal information to different organisations, service providers and friends. In addition, it highlights the state control over her body, exemplifying Foucauldian notions of biopower and biopolitics, and speaks to a critical reading of humanitarianism (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDT2mYg6mgo" target="_blank">Fassin, 2012</a>).</p>
<div id="attachment_4356" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/street.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4356 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/street-300x199.jpg" alt="street" width="300" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">‘The street I stay [on], or it is the prison’ – a male asylum applicant describing the control he feels over his everyday life.</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wenda&#8217;s story reveals a familiar one of forced disclosure.  What it does not capture are those spaces which prevent asylum seekers from sharing information that might be helpful to their case. This aspect of the asylum system has recently been amplified: in April 2014, for instance, the Government contract for asylum advice services was awarded to <a href="http://www.migranthelp.org/" target="_blank">Migrant Help</a>, to provide a phone helpline based in Dover as a replacement for the face-to-face service previously offered by the <a href="http://www.scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/" target="_blank">Scottish Refugee Council</a>. This change in service provision changes how asylum applicants accessing government funded support service can communicate their story. Tears, facial expressions and other embodiments of distress cannot be shared over the phone and, therefore, potentially go unheard and unnoticed. Such lack of direct contact compounds asylum applicants’ lack of control over the decision-making process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I end with a reflection on the nature of doing anthropological research in the area of asylum. Part of the process of building relationships of trust between participants and the researcher, getting to know somebody, becoming friends, is the mutual disclosure of personal information through sharing space and spending time together. However, a tension exists between participants’ ability to disclose and the researcher’s ability to discuss, write and represent their accounts. Due to the nature of this study, and the wider implications of making public some personal information, the content of some disclosures will always end with me.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">2014 was a busy year at Border Criminologies both on the website and for its international network of academic researchers and students. In March, we held a two-day seminar in Oxford on <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/foreign-national-prisoners/" target="_blank">foreign national prisoners</a> and <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/everyday-life-in-immigration-detention/" target="_blank">everyday life in immigration detention</a>. While papers from the former will be appearing later this year in a special issue of <a href="http://crj.sagepub.com" target="_blank">Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice</a>, lectures from both events are already available on the Border Criminologies iTunes account. We also hosted a number of speakers including <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/trajectories-of-immigration-enforcement/" target="_blank">Jennifer Chacon</a>, Catherine Dauvergne, <a href="http://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/news/refuge-from-deprivation-socio-economic-harm-and-non-refoulement-in-international-law-michelle-foster" target="_blank">Michelle Foster</a>, and <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/architecture-of-migrant-detention/" target="_blank">Tings Chak</a>, who discussed their research on the convergence of criminal and migration law in the US, the eroding protections of refugees, and the architectural design of immigration detention centres. Their talks are also all available on Border Criminologies <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/itunes-u/id850355607" target="_blank">iTunes</a> account</p>
<div id="attachment_4396" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/P1010392-300x225.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4396 size-full" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/P1010392-300x225.jpg" alt="Professor Jennifer Chacon All Souls College, Oxford" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Professor Jennifer Chacon<br /> All Souls College, Oxford</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Border Criminologies network currently includes <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/about/academic-researchers/" target="_blank">25 academic researchers</a>, <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/about/students/" target="_blank">eight postgraduate research students</a> along with an <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/about/advisory-group/" target="_blank">international advisory group</a> whose fourteen members represent academic, government, and non-government sectors. During 2014 members produced a host of monographs, journal articles and book chapters.  They also gave presentations at a range of international events and participated in social media, writing regular blog posts across a number of websites. Examples of their publications can be found on the <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/reseach/publications/" target="_blank">Research Publications</a> page, while accounts of some of their research activity can be found on the <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/reseach/current-research/" target="_blank">Current Research</a> page.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/9780198722571_140.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4397" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/9780198722571_140.jpg" alt="9780198722571_140" width="140" height="211" /></a>In the UK, Mary Bosworth published the first national study of life in British Immigration Removal Centre’s, <a href="http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198722571.do" target="_blank">Inside Immigration Detention</a>, while Ana Aliverti’s book on the criminalisation of migration, <a href="http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415820905/" target="_blank">Crimes of Mobility</a>, was declared joint winner of the British Society of Criminology book prize. Ruben Andersson’s ethnographic account of irregular migration into Europe <a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520282520" target="_blank">Illegality, Inc</a> was named the best study of migration by the migrants’ rights network, while in the US, Gabriella Sanchez offered a moving account of <a href="http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415703611/" target="_blank">Human Smuggling and Border Crossing</a> at the US-Mexico Border. Ines Hasselberg co-edited a special issue of the <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/cjms20/current" target="_blank">Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies</a>, <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369183X.2014.957171#.VG3JxvmsWuI" target="_blank">Deportation, Anxiety, Justice: New Ethnographic Perspectives</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of the <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/external-border-control/" target="_blank">Leverhulme International Network on External Border Control</a>, Border Criminologies established the first open access journal on the intersections between criminal justice and migration control. The <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalBrowse&amp;journal_id=2430849" target="_blank">SSRN Criminal Justice, Borders &amp; Citizenship Research Paper Series</a> currently includes over eighty papers, freely available to download.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2014 we published over 110 blog entries on a variety of topics related to border control: immigration detention, irregular migration, foreign national prisoners, deaths at the border. Our website statistics indicate that the blog was viewed approximately 60,000 times in 2014. Blog content is now syndicated by <a href="http://newstex.com" target="_blank">Newstex</a>, a web based business which feeds content to online users.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Looking ahead</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For 2015, we will continue to work on the Border Criminologies website adding new content, modes and means of interacting. Most immediately, in January 2015, we will launch a research forum, to encourage discussion and debate about applied research. Participants will need to sign up to access the forum. If you are interested, please email <a  href="javascript:smae_decode('YW5kcmlhbmkuZmlsaUBjcmltLm94LmFjLnVr');" target="_blank">&#065;&#110;&#100;&#114;&#105;&#097;&#110;&#105;&#032;&#070;&#105;&#108;&#105;</a>. We will also start running themed weeks, inviting blog entries on specific topics, to generate debate on particular issues. If you have an idea for particular issues, again, please email <a  href="javascript:smae_decode('YW5kcmlhbmkuZmlsaUBjcmltLm94LmFjLnVr');" target="_blank">&#065;&#110;&#100;&#114;&#105;&#097;&#110;&#105;&#032;&#070;&#105;&#108;&#105;</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_4401" style="width: 220px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fangchpencil.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4401" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fangchpencil-210x300.jpg" alt="Pencil and paper, China Campsfield House" width="210" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pencil and paper, China<br />Campsfield House</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2014 Mary Bosworth created an <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/archiving-detention/" target="_blank">Immigration Detention Archive</a>. In the first instance items in this collection will be digitized and displayed on the Border Criminologies website. The first range of items will be appearing soon. If you would like to contribute to the archive, please email <a  href="javascript:smae_decode('bWFyeS5ib3N3b3J0aEBjcmltLm94LmFjLnVr');" target="_blank">&#077;&#097;&#114;&#121;</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, once again this year we will be hosting a variety of speakers, starting with Alison Mountz in January discussing her international research on immigration detention. In June, we will also hold the first two <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/external-border-control/" target="_blank">Leverhulme international network</a> seminars, discussing external European border control in Oslo, and immigration detention in Oxford. Plans are currently underway for a two-day symposium on race, criminal justice and border control, provisionally scheduled for the autumn. The papers will appear in an edited volume and the lectures will be uploaded to our <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/itunes-u/id850355607" target="_blank">iTunes</a> account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Border Criminologies continues to experiment with new methods and modes of communication, reaching out to colleagues around the world. Alongside these web-based interactions, network members remain active in research and publications in more traditional academic arenas as well. As we move forward, we welcome comments, suggestions, and participation in these endeavours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We would like to thank everyone who contributed to Border Criminologies in 2014 and those of you who follow the blog and Border Criminologies through social media. We wish you a happy new year!</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by Ruby Shrimpton, a research assistant with the <a href="http://www.asylum-network.com" target="_blank">Asylum Network</a> and a postgraduate law student at BPP University. </em><em>The Asylum Network is a collective of academics and researchers led by Dr Nick Gill of the University of Exeter and Dr Deirdre Conlon of the University of Leeds.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the course of our ESRC-funded work with migrant support groups (much of the results of which can be found <a href="http://www.asylum-network.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/networks-of-asylum-support.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>), we at the <a href="http://www.asylum-network.com" target="_blank">Asylum Network</a> found that migrant support groups are tired of being approached by academics and student researchers for interviews or other data without having input into the research design process or access to the results.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.asylum-network.com" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-4191"><img class="alignright wp-image-4191 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/matchmaker-300x197.png" alt="matchmaker" width="300" height="197" /></a>In an effort to rectify this situation and to encourage participatory research in the field of migration, we have built a website to facilitate a process of informed research. We’re delighted to introduce the <a href="http://www.asylum-network.com" target="_blank">Asylum Network Research Matchmaker</a>, which is now fully functioning (albeit a little rough around the edges).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The website works like this: migrant support groups can register and post a ‘project’ or research idea that they’d like to have answered or explored, and potential researchers can ‘match’ themselves to a project, drawing on these posts in order to formulate their research questions in the light of an organisation’s identified needs. Alternatively, academics and students can create researcher ‘profiles’ indicating their skills and interests. Organisations that work with migrants can then search these profiles and contact the individuals quickly and securely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s much good will among students and academics for migrants in vulnerable situations. We’re hopeful that this website will help to ensure that research participants are active partners in the research process and that the outcome is mutually beneficial for all parties. To that end, the website also contains links to relevant publications and resources on the subject of participatory research that we believe are helpful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But, of course, the website will only work if it’s used. The matchmaker is currently in its infancy and it will only grow as people post projects and profiles, and as awareness is raised and matches are made. We aim to have thirty projects posted by January 2015. Please consider spending a few minutes to register and enter a project or profile, or to share the site with groups or individuals who may be interested.</p>
