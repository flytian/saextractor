<h4>MEN&#8217;S LAWN TENNIS REPORT</h4>

<p>Officers: Captain Dylan Grainger</p>

<p>Queen&#8217;s tennis has had a mixed season. The Cuppers tournament from last year was concluded at the beginning of Trinity Term this year, and in the final Queen&#8217;s narrowly lost (10 sets to 8) to a very strong St Catherine&#8217;s team. Consistently fielding strong Cuppers sides, which included Mark Carpenter, Thomas Bowden, Tyler Slade and others, took Queen&#8217;s to the final of this year&#8217;s competition where again St. Catherine&#8217;s were the opponents. The final score was 9 sets all, and to decide a winner the number of games won by each pair had to be counted. Unfortunately, Queen&#8217;s lost by a few games.</p>

<p>Men&#8217;s tennis was considerably less successful in the league. For the first time in several years Queen&#8217;s played in the premier division but, due to the absence of a few key players in crucial games, the team was relegated. Next year, under the guidance of Matt Pickles, it is hoped that Queen&#8217;s will re-enter the premier division and repeat its success in Cuppers.</p>
