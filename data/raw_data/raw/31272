			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by <a href="http://www.kent.ac.uk/sspssr/studying/postgraduate/research-student-profiles/Nagy-Veronika.html" target="_blank">Veronika Nagy</a>, doctoral student at the School of Social Policy, Sociology and Social Research of the University of Kent. Veronika is on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/newspeakineu" target="_blank">@newspeakineu</a> and at <a href="https://uu.academia.edu/VeronikaNagy" target="_blank">academia.edu</a>.   </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Review of <a href="http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781409463214" target="_blank"><em>Insider Research on Migration and Mobility: </em></a><em><a href="http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781409463214" target="_blank">International Perspectives on Researcher Positioning</a></em>, edited by Lejla Voloder and Liudmila Kirpitchenko (Ashgate, 2015).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781409463214" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5218"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5218" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Insider-Research.jpg" alt="Insider Research" width="170" height="263" /></a>What is the role of belonging in qualitative research? As an invitation to a discussion about research positioning, <em>Insider Research on Migration and Mobility</em> challenges essentialist approaches to insider/outsider research statuses in qualitative studies. The book stresses the situational nature of interactions between researchers and participants and aims to critically reflect on the role of insiderness in migration and mobility studies. Insiderness here refers to the shared experiences between researcher and research subjects that are drawn from specific features such ethnicity, age, gender, class occupation, or identity. These shared experiences maximise potential for sensitised, prolonged interaction which in turn may provide better access and more revealing data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Insider Research on Migration and Mobility </em>explores these matters from diverse angles of positioning, questioning perceived power reactions in the research field and providing reflexive insights of transgression concerning the dynamics of social and professional boundaries. The editors, Lejla Voloder and Liudmila Kirpitchenko, collected eleven essays from different countries written by scholars working in the fields of mobility, citizenship, and human rights. This multidisciplinary approach not only stretches the epistemological scope of insiderness, but also provides a full overview of the conceptual dilemmas of multiple positions along nationality, ethnicity, or religion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The collection starts with an extended introduction discussing the key conceptual challenges of objectivity, context, and power that form the basis for the three main sections of the book. This is an all-embracing collection of self-reflections described in a laid-back style that’s accessible to a wide audience. There are, at times, overlaps between descriptions of case studies and some chapters may read like field notes due to their restricted theoretical explanations. Nevertheless, all the essays embrace a broad field of secondary literature that softly extends or interweaves with the primary data analyses, while being presented accurately and in a clear form.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The text is divided into three sections, representing three levels of insiderness in order to advocate an analysis of situated actions from a discursive framework. In bringing the dichotomist insider/outsider positions gradually closer to each other, the positivist boundaries are increasingly blurred throughout the chapters until this disposition is fully dissolved in the final essay, presented as an autobiography. This editorial volume brakes with the conventional social, cultural, and spatial differentiation and the authors advocate dialogical encounters in the construction of identities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first part, ‘Dimensions of Insiderness,’ contains four essays that discuss the situational dimensions and epistemic concerns of insiderness, such as shifting power dynamics and multiple dimensions of belonging in different contexts. The first essay discusses how multiple positions of outsiderness indicate inclusion and identification between the dark skinned migrant researcher and his Aboriginal research participants. The chapter’s author, Michele Lobo, describes different identity markers, such as skin colour or nationality, that are consciously used by participants and interplay with the researchers’ identity, in order to claim likenesses in a particular context. This conscious anticipation is interpreted as a form of reciprocity in the research endeavour where participants have the power to decide their level of engagement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the following chapter, Farida Fozdar illustrates the situational flexibility of language as key to the study of race relations in New Zealand by using several aspects of her personal encounter that made her an outsider in her own context. The situational role of mobilised identities is further discussed in Chapter 4 where Christof van Mol et al. are researching foreign doctoral student fellows. They argue against the ‘censor of emotional encounters in the field’ and stress the significance of emotional involvement in the data collection process. Importantly, they analyse how the presumed characteristics of the researcher led to disruption with, and skepticism from, participants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second part of the volume, ‘Researching Home and Community,’ goes a step further in describing the complexities of positioning. Here the essays deliberate on the political and ethical challenges of insiderness when conducting fieldwork. Each chapter includes an account of the researcher’s personal experiences as they intersect with those of his or her participants, be they post-war experiences or memories of forced displacement. Moreover, the essays describe antagonising situations wherein the researchers face normative expectations of emotional detachment that, in turn, lead to their activist approach. The best illustration for this is Hariz Halilovich’s comparative research on the Bosnian refugee diaspora in different countries where the author bears the same migration background as his participants in Sweden and in the US. Although this section stresses the role of engagement, there’s no reference to the legal aspects of insiderness such as involvement in criminal activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The last section, ‘Producing Self, Producing Others,’ compiles the most reflexive and confronting essays of this collection. These studies critically analyse the impact of the researchers’ legal, social, and political positions in the production of data. Although every chapter in the book promotes intersubjectivity, this last section develops and discusses pertinent questions regarding knowledge production and its relation to the data as created and interpreted in the process of participation. Petra Andits, for instance, describes experiences of detachment from her Hungarian diaspora where social expectations provided access to data collection in a distrustful network. References of suspicion, distrust, and gossip are often neglected forms of data sources, yet as Andits suggests, even these may be decisive in the research process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Objectivity, emotional detachment, and positivist assumptions about research positioning are facing new challenges. Although the situational approach is generally accepted, the validity of data collected from an insider research position is still subjected to critical inquiry. This collection of young scholars gives a lively overview of research positioning, claiming more recognition for this dialectic approach. The book would have benefited from further methodological considerations, a concluding chapter, or a short discussion about the relation between insiderness, mobility, and research validity. Having said that, <em>Insider Research on Migration and Mobility</em> provides an important and timely contribution through its strong acknowledgement of fluidity between insiderness and outsiderness in the process of qualitative data collection. Ultimately, the book provides an excellent introduction to the field of positioning, not only for those interested in the complexities of insiderness, shifting power relations, and ethnicity, but also for those who perform research in the field of mobility studies.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by <a href="http://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/about/staff/pages/detail.aspx?StaffID=1162" target="_blank">Maria-Elena Young</a>, PhD Student, Department of Community Health Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles and a graduate student researcher at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. Her research focuses on using qualitative and quantitative methods to examine the public health impact of the immigration system, including the creation of legal status, immigration enforcement, and inclusive state and local immigrant policies. This post is the third installment of the Border Criminologies <strong>Themed Week on Deportation Threat, Realities, and Practices in the United States</strong> organised by <a href="http://www.ucmerced.edu/content/tanya-golash-boza" target="_blank">Tanya Golash-Boza</a>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGlK7URpqj8" target="_blank"><em>La jaula de oro</em></a>, a ballad by the norteño group <a href="http://lostigresdelnorte.com/main/" target="_blank">Los tigres del norte</a>, a man tells his mournful story of living in the United States without papers. He has worked hard. He has established himself and raised his children here. Yet he’s unable to enjoy a life of liberty and peace for fear of deportation:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="312"><em>De mi trabajo a mi casa</em><em>yo no se lo que me pasa</em><em>aunque soy hombre de hogar</em><em>casi no salgo a la calle</em><em>pues tengo miedo que me hallen</em></p>
<p><em>y me puedan deportar.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></td>
<td width="312"><em>From my work to my home</em><em>not sure what’s up with me.</em><em>Although a guy who loves his home</em><em>I never leave the house</em><em>‘cuz I’m scared that they’ll find me</em></p>
<p><em>and could deport me</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The song’s title<em>―</em>‘the cage of gold’―provides a metaphor not only for the actual borders of the US, but the barriers created by enforcement:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="312"><em>De qué me sirve el dinero</em><em>si estoy como prisionero</em><em>dentro de esta gran prisión</em><em>cuando me acuerdo hasta lloro</em><em>y aunque la jaula sea de oro</em></p>
<p><em>no deja de ser prisión.</em></td>
<td width="312"><em>What good to me is money,</em><em>if I live like a prisoner</em><em>inside this huge prison?</em><em>When I think of it I cry.</em><em>The cage may be made of gold,</em></p>
<p><em>but it never fails to be a prison.</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://accessdeniedblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><img class="alignright wp-image-5532 size-full" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ad-logo.jpg" alt="ad-logo" width="270" height="184" /></a>As illustrated in the song, immigrants experience numerous sources of stress from this <em>la jaula</em> or cage, whether it’s immigration enforcement and the direct threat of deportation or workplace enforcement that creates poor job security and low wages. As the man becomes more settled in the US, the daily stress he experiences doesn’t diminish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Wear and Tear of Daily Stress</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the strength and resilience of individuals such as <em>La jaula</em>’s protagonist, this stress wears and tears on people’s well-being, a negative consequence that shouldn’t be taken lightly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Public health research is beginning to show that <em>la jaula―</em>immigrants’ social and economic environments―may be harmful to health. The following are some key implications.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><em>Barriers to health care:</em> Undocumented immigrants face more barriers to health care than other immigrants, including late or inadequate <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21530038" target="_blank">prenatal care</a> or less <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19841999" target="_blank">preventive care</a>. Undocumented immigrants in communities where police participate in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25521886" target="_blank">immigration enforcement</a>, as well as those who express <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17987916" target="_blank">concern about deportation</a>, regardless of legal status, are also less likely to seek care.</li>
<li><em>Psychological and mental distress:</em> When compared to their documented counterparts, undocumented immigrants experience higher levels of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17987916" target="_blank">fear of deportation</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20611049" target="_blank">anxiety and depression</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22643614" target="_blank">psychological distress</a>, and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4254683/" target="_blank">stress</a> from low-paying work and the process of acculturation.</li>
<li><em>Possible risk for chronic disease: </em>Immigrants are generally considered to be healthier than US born individuals. Recently, I conducted a study of the relationship between legal status and blood pressure and body mass index (BMI) in a representative sample from <a href="http://lasurvey.rand.org/design/" target="_blank">Los Angeles County</a>. Undocumented immigrants who had resided in the US fewer than 15 years had higher blood pressure than their documented counterparts, taking socio-demographic factors into account<em>. </em>Yet, undocumented and documented immigrants in the US for more than 15 years had similarly high levels of blood pressure, comparable to their presumably <em>less</em> healthy US born counterparts. There were no differences in BMI among the undocumented, documented, or US born individuals. More research is needed to understand the long-term impact of stress on physical health, such as risk for cardiovascular disease. These findings, however, suggest that more recent undocumented immigrants may have poorer health than documented immigrants and over time neither group maintains better health than US born individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Health is an Immigrant Rights Issue </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://http://pages.vassar.edu/children-of-immigration/2012/05/11/undocumented-immigrants-mental-health/" target="_blank"><img class=" size-full wp-image-5533 alignleft" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/index2.jpg" alt="index2" width="225" height="171" /></a>Until recently, health researchers have presumed that immigrants are relatively healthy. Immigrants’ experiences living under our nation’s enforcement system haven’t been examined as a possible risk to health. There is now mounting evidence that the threat of deportation and other exclusionary immigration policies have consequences for the health of immigrants. Undocumented immigrants, in particular, may be uniquely exposed to the wear and tear of stress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The health and well-being of all immigrants is critical to the well-being of any nation. Public health researchers and practitioners, as well as others working to advance the rights of immigrants, have a responsibility to ensure that all immigrants are free from a <em>jaula </em>that not only denies them rights, but harms their mental and physical well-being.</p>

This post is part of the joint blog series on ‘Gender and Migration’ co-hosted by Border Criminologies and <a href="https://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">COMPAS</a>. Posts of this series will be published in both blogs <span style="text-decoration: underline;">every Friday</span> until the end of June.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Incorporating a feminist perspective, many community psychology scholars have stressed the importance of adopting a reflexive practice based on the sharing of how we conduct our work in different contexts with diverse participants/collaborators, and how our own personal histories, values, and social statuses have an impact on the research process and outcomes. As <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1005120001986" target="_blank">Mulvey and colleagues</a> highlight, these ‘messy accounts’ may help reveal whether and how our work is able to challenge power relations and inequalities, especially when we’re working with marginalized groups.</p>
<div id="attachment_4905" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/detention-1.png" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-4905 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/detention-1-300x225.png" alt="detention 1" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Detainees behind bar fences at Ponte Galeria, Rome’s Center for Identification and Expulsion (Photo: F. Esposito)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For me, reflexivity has been a necessary tool to navigate the complexity of my <em>messy </em>research work within Ponte Galeria, Rome’s Center for Identification and Expulsion (CIE), the main migration-related detention center in Italy. The tensions and vulnerabilities I was experiencing began to acquire meaning, revealing of the research process and its intrinsic power imbalances. Messiness, which should not be associated with noise, as articulated recently by <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10464-014-9645-3" target="_blank">Edison Trickett and colleagues</a>, became a guideline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’ll always remember the feelings that arose the first time I entered Ponte Galeria. It was 2009, and I was working for <a href="http://www.befreecooperativa.org" target="_blank">BeFree Social Cooperative</a>, a feminist NGO in Rome engaged in combating violence against women. We were allowed into the CIE  to meet the migrant women held there and provide them with legal and psycho-social advice. I remember the large and rusty entry-gate as well as the many gates (physical and symbolic) I had to pass through… It was an emotionally taxing―but at the same time enriching―experience that indelibly marked me. It taught me that ‘sisterhood between women,’ an ideal very dear to me as a feminist, can be difficult to achieve when other salient identities, apart from gender, are at play. In the context of the CIE, my identity as a white, native, member of the dominant group was especially important.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some years later, I crossed that entry-gate again, as well as the many gates beyond it, this time as a doctoral student engaged in a research project on life in migration-related detention that seeks to document the noxious effects of such oppressive systems.</p>
<div id="attachment_4906" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/detention-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-4906 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/detention-2-300x225.jpg" alt="detention 2" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Main corridor of the female living unit at Ponte Galeria (Photo: F. Esposito)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite my professional background in the CIE, which has very much helped me to obtain research authorization and reduce the perception that I’m a ‘total outsider’ by the center staff, it hasn’t saved me from facing a variety of tensions and vulnerabilities. Staff members often look at me with suspicion and mistrust, making it hard to engage and work together. Yet, some members have been more open  than others, helping me ‘enter the field,’ becoming my gatekeepers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My insider/outsider status continuously shifts across time, space, and relationships.  My gender identity, age, and professional status  influence my positions within the research field as well as the relationships with different individuals and groups in the CIE. As a woman, I’m not allowed to access male areas without an escort of male security officers, being considered ‘vulnerable’ and ‘at risk.’ Like most detained women (except sex workers, Roma, and ex-prisoners who are considered to be ‘dangerous subjects’), I am ‘a potential victim’ and so ‘in need of protection.’ As <a href="http://www.palgrave-journals.com/fr/journal/v94/n1/abs/fr200944a.html" target="_blank">Gabriella Alberti</a> notes in relation to migrant women detained in Lesvos, Greece, ‘the regime of “gendered detention management”’ works to reproduce women’s vulnerability, while attempting to silence their voices as political subjects. My experience reveals the workings of this ‘technology of gender,’ using the words of <a href="http://books.google.it/books/about/Technologies_of_Gender.html?id=twvWBdWSTSMC&amp;redir_esc=y" target="_blank">Teresa De Lauretis</a>.  I have often been mistaken for a master&#8217;s student. Although irritating, such a ‘harmless status’, rendered even less alarming by my gender, set some staff, particularly security officers at ease, encouraging them to disclose  confidential and controversial information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My relationships with detained migrants are also personally challenging. My identity as a native-born Italian citizen, and my privileged status as member of the dominant group, has, at times, made it difficult to establish connections and relationships of trust. During the long conversations held in the ‘rooms’ or in the corridors of the CIE, migrants’ discussions frequently addressed the ‘<em>injustice of being confined just for their migrant status</em>,’ including me in the group of the oppressors, the Italians, who made them suffer ‘<em>due to racism and xenophobia</em>.’ ‘<em>Italy wicked! This place is no good!</em>’ a Nigerian woman once shouted at me, it’s ‘<em>because we are black, that’s</em> <em>why Italian treat us like this! Like animals!</em>.’ It’s not easy to deal with the anger, frustration, and distress of people who identify you with the dominant group responsible for their suffering. It&#8217;s also not easy to overcome their diffidence and mistrust―the main emotional dimensions within the CIE―and to build collaborative and open relationships. A key, resonating questions is <em>Why should you be different?</em> It’s been hard for me to accept this accusation, especially from detained women, as I had hoped that sharing the same gender identity, would enable empathy and reciprocity . With male detainees instead, apart from the constraints imposed by my reduced mobility in their areas and the challenges also faced with women, the main difficulty relates to their use of masculine power to challenge our relationship.</p>
<div id="attachment_4907" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/detention-3.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-4907 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/detention-3-225x300.jpg" alt="detention 3" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lateral corridor of the female living unit at Ponte Galeria (Photo: F. Esposito)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’ve found that by being open, authentic, and honest about my experiences and identities, as well as about my research goals, it’s been possible to establish meaningful relationship with many of those locked up. Some wanted to know more about me to decide if and how to disclose information about themselves. In other words, they wanted trust in exchange for trust. Women often asked if I was married, if I had children, where I was living. Sharing my experiences, including migratory ones (I lived in London for almost a year and now I reside in Lisbon), and my struggles helped establish connections. Many were familiar with Lisbon and Portugal, having passed through there for several reasons; the evocation of those places reminded them of moments of freedom and happiness. A Roma woman asked me, for instance, if and when I could go to Fatima’s sanctuary in Portugal, to light a candle for her to have other children. More practically, I also shared  information about rights, laws, procedures, strategies, and advocacy services available inside the CIE. Indeed, many detainees lacked this essential information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During this process, which is ongoing, some relationships became so strong that they continue after detention. I’m still in contact with many men and women who keep me informed about their lives. New technologies help: Facebook and WhatsApp make it easier to share information regardless of where we are in the world. I communicate with those who are still detained over the phone  or via text message. (Unfortunately, there are no internet connections or computers available inside the CIE.) Some detainees/ex-detainees have become long-term participants, actively involved in the development of the research.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the oppressive context of the CIE, I have learned that by being an <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FB%3AAJCP.0000014316.27091.e8" target="_blank">honest and passionate witness</a>, it’s possible to create meaningful human relationships. Even so, it’s necessary to engage in an ongoing exercise of reflexivity, to continuously reexamine and reposition myself and become more sensitive and able to navigate power differentials endemic in research relationships, especially in sites of confinement like this one. Fieldwork is messy and personal, hence, as feminists argue, political.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by </em><a href="http://www.didattica-cps.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Show?_id=lgarigli" target="_blank"><em>Luigi Gariglio</em></a><em>, Lecturer in Visual Studies and Sociology of Communication at the University of Turin</em><em> and </em><a href="http://www.crim.ox.ac.uk/AcademicVisitors2014-15.php" target="_blank"><em>academic visitor</em></a><em> at the Centre for Criminology, University of Oxford.</em> <em>This post is the fifth and final instalment of the Border Criminologies <strong>Themed Week on Visual Methodologies</strong>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, Border Criminologies is running a series of posts on visual methods. Here, I reflect on the importance of bridging the gap between visual methods and visual culture in ethnographic research on the carceral state. In so doing, I discuss several ways in which visual methods help unpack the complexity of the social lives and struggles within custodial facilities focusing, in particular, on photo-elicitation.</p>
<div id="attachment_5112" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-5112" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Special-Hospital1.jpg" alt="Special-Hospital" width="350" height="233" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The wall of the hospital from inside at night. (Image: Luigi Gariglio © 2014)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Images are increasingly present in our daily lives and for a growing number researchers, have become an integral part of the research process. Some scholars of visual culture, however, have critiqued visual methodologies due to a perceived failure among researchers to adequately account for the complex and mutually constitutive relationships between the visual and the social. The aim, in my understanding, for both those interested in visual methods and visual culture, is to study the social world―institutions, interactions, power struggles, gender, race, sexualities, etc.―and not ‘only’ the visual.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Visuality is a key concept that incorporates some Foucauldian ideas of vision, panopticism, normalization, and the gaze. Vision is always socially constructed; it isn’t neutral and is always embedded in <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/tag/kate-west/" target="_blank">power relations</a>. In other words, there’s neither such a thing as an ‘innocent eye,’ to use <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/States-Denial-Knowing-Atrocities-Suffering/dp/0745623921" target="_blank">Cohen</a>’s term, nor a neutral <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-disciplinary-frame" target="_blank">visual technology</a>. In an effort to unpack the multi-layered dimensions of visuality, paraphrasing <a href="http://monoskop.org/File:Hal_Foster_Vision_and_Visuality_%28Discussions_in_Contemporary_Culture%29_1988.pdf" target="_blank">Foster</a>, we can think of three questions: How do we see? How are we able, allowed, or made to see? How do we see this seeing and the unseeing therein?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Visual research is embedded in broader hegemonic discourses and power’s struggles. Researchers can produce ethnographic images, but what’s not shown is important, particularly as such images may be constructed as ‘truth.’ For example, an image of a certain prison wing in an academic book may be perceived as a ‘real’ representation that shows us what that prison really looks like because of the authority of academia or ethnography, as a ‘regime of truth.’ However, that particular image is the outcome of both a network of power struggles in which the researcher is imbued and one’s personal (political) choices. The point here is that such complexities are invisible in the image. The image appears to simply show us what’s in front of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Visual methods are a good way to produce counter-hegemonic research―even as visual methods alone don’t necessarily do so―allowing researchers to ‘write’ visual ethnography differently. By combining ethnographic image-making and text, taking the <a href="http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/3/463.short" target="_blank">photo documentary tradition</a> and the new <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Post-Photography-Artist-Camera-Elephant-Books/dp/1780672284" target="_blank">post-photojournalism field</a> seriously, researchers demonstrate that images aren’t ancillary illustrations. They’re a key part of making sense of the field and, at the same time, constituting it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nonetheless, a crucial ethical question remains. <a href="http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/3/463.abstract" target="_blank">What right have I to represent you?</a> This simple demand unmasks the uneven power relations always embedded in the photographic encounter between a photographer and a subject―an asymmetrical relationship that’s otherwise ‘invisible’ in the picture. For obvious reasons, this issue is especially troubling inside a custodial institution where it may be necessary―yet problematic―to ‘<a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/P/bo12346074.html" target="_blank">picture atrocity</a>.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Visual methods can assist researchers in developing new or different kinds of knowledge. I found, for example, that using <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/from-the-field-special-hospital/" target="_blank">photo-elicitation</a> to stimulate different narratives among participants in custodial settings is crucial for researchers using visual methods. Any kind of image can be used for this purpose: existing images, ethnographic images produced by the researcher during fieldwork, or <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/photo-story/" target="_blank">images produced by the participants</a>. It all depends on what we’re allowed to do, what we want to study, and the practical constraints in which the fieldwork is embedded. At the same time, however, using visual methods doesn’t necessarily  produce a more <a href="http://eth.sagepub.com/content/16/1/95.refs" target="_blank">participatory research</a> project.</p>
<div id="attachment_5126" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-5126 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/gariglio_detail_image-300x225.jpg" alt="gariglio_detail_image" width="300" height="225" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image 1: the first image used in the photo-elicitation interviews with staff and prisoners. This photo is of the signs indicating the prison and the special hospital (which are housed in the same building). (Image: Luigi Gariglio © 2014)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Visual researchers are often accused of using images instrumentally in a quasi-positivistic way so as to elicit narrations limited by what’s ‘in the frame’ and not regarding issues of representation, the gaze, invisibility, and so forth. I strongly resist this critique. Participants are often well placed to think deeply and complexly about images integrated in the research process. To develop this point, I now turn to my own <a href="http://crim.law.ox.ac.uk/the-use-of-force-inside-a-special-hospital-photo-elicitation-and-qualitative-interviews-in-the-ethnographic-field/" target="_blank">ethnographic research on prison officer use of force</a> in an Italian custodial complex. During the ethnographic photo-elicitation I conducted there, I realized the potential of photo-elicitation to study invisibility, visuality, and power struggles. Take, for example, the responses that one particular image (image 1) drew. The image depicts two road signs indicating the prison (Casa Circondariale) and the forensic psychiatric hospital (Ospedale Psichiatico Giudiziario) just one hundred metres from the facility. During the photo-elicitations, interviewees responded differently to the photo, often spontaneously introducing several layers of interpretation.  In some instances I prompted them to reflect on a particular aspect of the image.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many compared the two institutions (prison and hospital) indicated by the road sign. Others interpreted the image simply as their route to their work place, leading some to reminisce about their first day on duty. Still others discussed the symbolical meaning of the photograph, referring to them as the ‘dark and dirty prison,’ and in so doing, interpreting the perceived intent of the image. Finally, a number questioned the politics of the image and  the physical signs themselves, challenging the politics embedded in those ‘transparent’ indications. For example, one prison officer looked at this image and started to laugh. I didn’t understand why he was laughing. Suddenly he said ‘ah ah, a hospital?’ while indicating the blue background and the red cross of the road sign―depicted in the photograph―typically used for a ‘normal’ hospital. Then he continued: ‘I don’t know why they have to mask the reality… You know it well now. After all these months… is it a hospital for you?’ I didn’t answer. ‘It’s a prison!’ he replied, and finished talking. Another interviewee, a doctor looked at the same image and told me that he felt ashamed any time that he thought of the sign. He also told me that he knew I presented that image precisely for that reason. Another prison officer, working in the forensic psychiatric hospital, remarked: ‘that sign is bullshit! Who sends them here? A doctor? Or a judge? They are criminal; patients, but first of all criminal.’ All of the prisoners I spoke with were dismissive of the image, saying this facility is anything but a hospital, and that the authorities want to portray it as a hospital. Not everyone can come to see it, they reasoned; unfortunately, among those working or living on the wing, it’s the prisoners themselves who’ve introduced the idea of harm and violated rights in the context of the hospital setting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As this one example suggests, visual methods don’t solely elicit positivistic descriptions of what’s in the frame. On the contrary, methods like photo-elicitation can help the researcher to unpack the complexity of the field, eliciting emotions, memories, perceptions, and opinions. Interviewees may reflect on what’s in frame, what they didn’t expect to see but is there, and about what they expected to find in the image but didn’t. Together, visual methods and visual culture can contribute both to the visuality and the invisibility, and the power struggles that inhere in these violent institutions.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Post by <a  href="javascript:smae_decode('ZmVzcG9zaXRvQGlzcGEucHQ=');" >&#070;&#114;&#097;&#110;&#099;&#101;&#115;&#099;&#097;&#032;&#069;&#115;&#112;&#111;&#115;&#105;&#116;&#111;</a>, Doctoral Candidate in Community Psychology, ISPA-University Institute, Lisbon. This post is the third instalment of the Border Criminologies <strong>Themed Week on Visual Methodologies</strong>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was 3 September 2013 when I received an email from the Prefecture of Rome (the local branch of the Ministry of the Interior) notifying me that I had been given permission to access the center for identification and expulsion (CIE) of Rome, Ponte Galeria. I had officially submitted my request three months earlier. Given the well-known difficulties of getting access to these sites, especially for research purposes, I was anxiously awaiting the answer. Needless to say, when I finally got a positive response I was very happy. What surprised me most was that the extent of the freedom they allowed. In addition to interviews, I could film and take photographs so long as I respected detainees’ privacy and guaranteed their anonymity. I had not expected this kind of flexibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I decided not to film, since it was beyond the scope of my research goals and I felt that it would’ve been much too invasive for detainees as well as for staff. It turns out that later this year, Raffaella Cosentino and Alessio Genovese made the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEDS3piSgQ" target="_blank">first documentary</a> shot inside Italian CIEs, including the centers of Rome, Bari, and Trapani. Instead, I chose to take the opportunity to photograph inside the detention center.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the time, I didn’t have any idea about how to use images in my research, nor about which pictures I wanted to take or even on what to focus. Once inside, I started to photograph objects, spaces, and events that attracted my attention and were accessible. I usually take photographs when there’s some privacy. It’s an intimate act, one that can feel quite invasive. Given the levels of distrust that often characterize so many relationships within the CIE, I worry about what people think I’ll do with the images I take.</p>
<div id="attachment_5079" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/eposito-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-5079 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/eposito-1-225x300.jpg" alt="eposito 1" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sunset through the bar fences at Ponte Galeria (Photo: F. Esposito)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I alternate periods of participant observation and interviews and informal conversations with detainees and staff members with times in which I walk around Ponte Galeria, taking pictures that make sense to me in that particular moment. In both cases, I don&#8217;t have a guiding hypothesis or an a priori framework that guides me in what to include and what to avoid. I just try to grasp the intricacies of the complex reality that is the CIE. As <a href="http://www.qualitative-research.net/index.php/fqs/article/view/1484/2998" target="_blank">Melanie Friend</a> argues in relation to her four-year (2003-2007) research process towards the multi-media artwork <a href="http://www.melaniefriend.com/bordercountry/" target="_blank">Border Country</a>, oral and visual representations are both powerful forms of portraying individuals and narrating stories. In my research project, I also conceive of them in such a way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So far, I’ve discovered that images are a useful means to record particular events and moments in the course of fieldwork. An image condenses a set of sensations, colors, smells, sounds, and emotions that are often difficult to put into words. As a research tool, this aspect of images can be enormously powerful. As I review an image, even when I’m in my office, I can suddenly recall the context, both physical and emotional, in which it was taken. In this way, I use the evocative power of the image to be able to ‘go back’ into the field when I’m out of it. In a similar fashion, images can make ‘real’ issues that privileged groups (Italian citizens, in my case) prefer to ignore. Letting people ‘enter’ immigration detention centers through such images can provoke a strong impact, raising people’s awareness.</p>
<div id="attachment_5080" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/eposito-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-5080 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/eposito-2-300x225.jpg" alt="eposito 2" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Female living unit at Ponte Galeria (Photo: F. Esposito)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, as I’ve already noted, taking images can be invasive. The (potentially) exploitative and asymmetrical nature of research relationships is unavoidable; images may strengthen this dynamic by catering to voyeuristic appetites, both of the researchers and those who have access to the pictures. Photographs can objectify and reinforce stereotypes, especially when they concern marginalized and oppressed groups. In this sense, and according to my authorization, the photos I take mostly portray the CIE’s interior spaces and landscapes―environments that are far from familiar, ordinary, and sterile, similar to the ones exposed in Border Country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The majority of detainees don’t like to be photographed: they don’t want their friends and families to know that they are in detention; they’re ashamed of their condition, and often feel guilty about it. Many, especially women, are also worried about their safety since they’re escaping situations of persecution, domestic violence, trafficking, and sexual or labor exploitation. Ethical concerns are particularly relevant in these specific situations, and more generally in sites like these ones, where people experience a certain degree of powerlessness. Detainees’ concerns, fears, and personal preferences need to be respected; special care must be taken so my actions as a researcher don’t expose them to any form of risk or increase their distress.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Images can be a powerful tool to portray the lived experiences of people in sites of confinement, especially when integrated with other methods, such as oral narratives. They can tell the ‘research story,’ also speaking to the various ways in which, as researchers, we are part of it. However, it’s necessary to engage in an ongoing reflection on the meanings that images assume in our research processes. Such a dialogue allows us as researchers to become more aware of and able to navigate tensions and challenges that inevitably arise by using visual methodologies, including the tensions between voyeurism and knowledge production, as well as that between ‘giving voice’ and possessing/exploiting others’ voices.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by <a href="http://www.crim.ox.ac.uk/profile.php?who=kate.west" target="_blank">Kate West</a>, DPhil candidate at the Centre for Criminology, University of Oxford. </em><em>Kate’s doctoral research explores narratives ascribed to late-nineteenth century prisoner portraits (mug shots) in the work of Cesare Lombroso’s ‘Criminal Woman,’ Perth Prison Scotland, and the Salpêtrière hospital France. It argues that these narratives derive from the politics of race, gender, and class rather than the photographs themselves. This post is the second instalment of the Border Criminologies <strong>Themed Week on Visual Methodologies</strong>.  </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My post constitutes part of Border Criminologies’ ongoing efforts to integrate the visual as method into its epistemological discourse. As a doctoral student working on criminology’s historical and continued neglect of the image, it seems important to ask a question about why we may wish to do so. This ‘why’ question raises a fundamental epistemological question: how does the image ‘work’? Or, more explicitly, how do the image’s politics justify its employment as method (in the <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/seamless-transitions/" target="_blank">case of James Bridle’s work as image-maker</a>) or interpretation (in the <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/visualising-immigration-detention/" target="_blank">case of Sarah Turnbull as spectator</a>)?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Lombroso" target="_blank"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-5040 alignright" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lombroso_1-192x300.jpg" alt="Lombroso_1" width="192" height="300" /></a>As criminologists, the most disciplinary-relevant (and perhaps obvious) answer to this question can be found in the origins of the discipline. Cesare Lombroso features in the field most often in terms of historical temporality (the late-nineteenth century) or as an epistemological counterpoint. Less frequently explored is the relationship between Lombroso’s methodological use of images and his positivist epistemology. Approaching his work in this way reveals criminology’s counter-intuitively intimate relationship to the visual, but within an epistemology with which Border Criminologies should take issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lombroso understood the image to work in terms of the realist paradigm. In this view, pictures, and particularly photographs, were analogous to their material or real-world referents. Underpinning this perspective was the implicit assumption that the image, somehow, <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-burden-of-representation" target="_blank">‘speaks for itself.’</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why, as border (visual) criminologists, should we care today about Lombroso’s use of images? Aren’t they ancient history? The answer is, quite simply, ‘no.’ In the criminal court, for example, the image occupies a privileged position of evidential objectivity. <a href="http://tcr.sagepub.com/content/4/1/5.abstract" target="_blank">Nikolas Rose</a> shows how the criminal court, with its emphasis on moral responsibility and blameworthiness for actions, has historically been resistant to questions surrounding identity or character, questions which become relevant at sentencing and only as mitigating factors. However, character-based defences based on apparent biological predispositions have been accepted in the court where images, rather than oral testimony alone, have been used as evidence. Likewise, <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CXyNAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;dq=captive+images+race,+crime+photography&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C7W8ib-Whb&amp;sig=TdTSh3DGnWd5GlftKX7R6ll7eaY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7EL3VMyXOOy07Qa6nIDYDg&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=captive%20images%20race%2C%20crime%20photography&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Katherine Bieber</a> has explored how apparently objective images are used in and by actors of the criminal court to construct and prosecute character, namely ‘race,’ and perpetuate colonialist racial politics in Australia. The point here is that images are inherently political. Contrary to the premise on which they are employed in the criminal court, the image doesn’t operate without the discourses of race, geography, and nation-state that are in fact inscribed onto it. Lombroso’s images, incidentally, were used similarly as evidence of the apparent immutability of race, gender, and class in the ideological (albeit constitutional) unification and making of the Italian nation-state.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A different version of the same discussion can be found in the idea of ‘affective and communicative power of visualisations’ that <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/visualising-immigration-detention/" target="_blank">Sarah speaks about in her post published yesterday</a>. Perhaps as criminologists unfamiliar with the visual, we might locate this affect in the materiality of the image as distinct from text, a medium with which we are more familiar. Roland Barthes infamously speaks of the image’s punctum (its power to stir or provoke a personal (emotional) reaction) as compared with another side of a duality, studium (the image’s power to frame or situate a larger cultural or interpretive discourse). Yet, in either case, affect doesn’t exist <em>qua</em> image, but rather comes from the discourses within which we, as makers and viewers, situate it. The image as political is evidenced by the existence of a huge literature written by prominent intellectuals who work across the disciplinary divides of biopolitcs, art history, and visual culture, such as <a href="http://www.versobooks.com/books/460-frames-of-war" target="_blank">Judith Butler</a>, <a href="http://www.penguin.co.uk/books/regarding-the-pain-of-others/9780141012377/" target="_blank">Susan Sontag</a>, <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo5907594.html" target="_blank">Georg Didi-Huberman</a>, and <a href="http://www.versobooks.com/books/1029-the-emancipated-spectator" target="_blank">Jacques Rancière</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Acknowledging the inherently political character of the image means that as (border) criminologists we must make, view, and/or engage with images in a way that’s sensitive to their inherent political dimension. This is why Border Criminologies researchers employ visual methodologies that contravene the realist paradigm to integrate image-making (method) and image-interpretation (theory) into an epistemology that understands the image as political.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sarah’s interpretation of James’ installation reflects on these epistemological and methodological ideas particularly well. The self-consciously cultivated artificiality of James’ (moving) images parodies the ideological operation of detention—to identify, segregate, and in effect create a risky population. As a viewer, Sarah’s experience seems to capture this quality; the immersion in this ‘digital walkthrough’ contravenes her experience of being in detention centres as a researcher. Yet, whilst Sarah’s own experience of detention appears to allow her to identify the politics of James’ images, what about those of us, she quite rightly notes, who have never experienced detention, or another carceral environment, in any meaningful way? How can we prevent the walkthrough from becoming tantamount to voyeurism? The distribution of <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/gaining-access-to-prison/" target="_blank">cameras to detainees</a> attends to this ethical predicament well, as does the <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/tag/immigration-detention/" target="_blank">Immigration Detention Archive</a>. These visual methodologies privilege the lived experience of detention, breathing life into images that would otherwise be passively consumed by those of us who can only ever be ‘outsiders.’ Being brought into this dialogue as spectators, we can bear witness to the politics or affect that James’ images were designed to stimulate.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sarah’s final observation about the absence of detainees from James’ work―which James himself also <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/seamless-transitions/" target="_blank">notes</a>―raises important questions about the ethics of spectatorship. Practical ethical concerns, as Sarah mentions, oscillate around ideas about privacy. However, from the perspective of the ethics of spectatorship or looking, to ‘document’ (in the modernist or twentieth century ‘fly-on-the-wall’ sense) treads too thinly the line of objectification and voyeurism. What is the middle ground for criminologists who, for some reason, may wish to include detainees or prisoners when making images for their research? Long ago, sociologist <a href="http://www.americanethnography.com/article.php?id=69#.VPdN_CnVvzI" target="_blank">Howard Becker</a> suggested that social science should learn from the critique of the documentary photography tradition. The absence of detainees in James’ work speaks to awareness in that tradition which is exemplified in <a href="http://www.vincentborrelli.com/pages/books/111469/sophie-ristelhueber/sophie-ristelhueber-wb-west-bank" target="_blank">Sophie Ristelhueber</a>’s photography of the Westbank and <a href="http://imaginarymuseum.org/MHV/PZImhv/JaarRwandaProject.html" target="_blank">Afredo Jarr’s</a> photography of the Rwandan genocide. Similarly, Edmund Clarke, the first photographer to gain access to <a href="http://www.dewilewispublishing.com/PHOTOGRAPHY/GUANTANAMO.html" target="_blank">Guantánamo</a> and a <a href="http://www.herepress.org/publications/edmund-clark-control-order-house/" target="_blank">control order house</a> (a carceral environment for those suspected of terrorist-related activity), doesn’t feature detainees in his work, which arguably constitutes a more critical comment on detention, highlighting the artificiality and politics of the detention environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To close, I’d like to reflect on the image and criminology more generally. Being asked to write for Border Criminologies highlights the politics of canonicity. At the beginning of my doctorate, the term ‘visual criminology’ provided a ‘hook’ or opening for my work. Now, as I approach the end of that project, it makes little sense to speak of a ‘visual criminology’ in the way it has been spoken about by, for example, cultural criminologists. As in anthropology and sociology, the visual is a method and in that sense my doctorate is not ‘visual’ because mug shots or portraits feature throughout the work, but because of my engagement with the epistemological assumptions behind the visual method of late-nineteenth century positivist criminology.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Post by <a href="http://www.crim.ox.ac.uk/profile.php?who=ines.hasselberg" target="_blank">Ines Hasselberg</a>, postdoctoral research fellow at the <a href="http://www.crim.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Centre for Criminology,</a> University of Oxford. This post is the <strong>final</strong> instalment of the Border Criminologies <strong>Themed Week on Research Methodologies</strong>, organised by <a href="http://www.crim.ox.ac.uk/profile.php?who=mary.bosworth" target="_blank">Prof Mary Bosworth</a>. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, Border Criminologies is launching a research forum to discuss the challenges of conducting field research on border control.  We hope it will foster open, frank, and supportive discussion. In this post, I reflect on the importance of this forum (and any other such initiatives) to researchers and practitioners in the field of border control.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will start with an event that illustrates why such initiatives are significant to many researchers. Last summer, at the European Association of Social Anthropology (EASA) 2014 conference, <a href="http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/people/carolina-sanchez-boe" target="_blank">Carolina Sanchez Boe</a> and I convened a panel entitled <a href="http://www.nomadit.co.uk/easa/easa2014/panels.php5?PanelID=2998" target="_blank"><em>Prison Ethnographies, Research Intimacies and Social Change</em></a>. With this panel we wanted to discuss and reflect on the particular challenges of conducting anthropological studies in and of prison establishments. The idea was to explore the dynamics of intimacy and collaboration in prison ethnographies while paying particular attention to matters of positionality, access, and personal engagement. Much to our surprise, as we believed there was a current lack of general interest in such matters (after all, almost no one is writing about them!), the panel generated much attention. In fact, we received a very large number of submissions, many of which regarded research carried out not in prisons but in other sites of confinement such as immigration detention centres, psychiatric institutions, and house arrest. Those researchers felt there was no other space for them to present and so we opened up the scope of the panel from the start. As the panel unfolded, it became clear from the presentations and discussions that the difficulties in researching such practices and institutions of confinement meant that researchers go through specific pains and ethical dilemmas. It was felt that there was not a space to voice and share these concerns and obtain peer support and often much needed advice―there were calls for setting up a network of support and ultimately the <a href="http://www.easaonline.org/networks/confinementnet/" target="_blank">EASA Anthropology of Confinement Network</a> was created to that end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here at Border Criminologies we have been debating similar issues for the past couple of years. But when it comes to the study of border control, issues of access, method, and ethics are not limited to institutions of confinement (as prisons and immigration detention centres) but expand to other institutions of border control and civil society, as well as to other spheres of private and public domains. Furthermore, as <a href="http://www.uva.nl/over-de-uva/organisatie/medewerkers/content/k/a/b.kalir/b.kalir.html" target="_blank">Barak Kalir</a> so pertinently pointed out to me not long ago, researching border control often means researching not just practices but processes: processes of illegality, deportability, securitization, criminalisation, and so on. But what methods may be deployed in the study of processes? And can one access the many sites, actors, and temporalities that are often part of it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my own doctoral research on the deportation of foreign-national offenders in the UK, it was clear from the start that deportation was not an event but a process that begins far before foreign nationals are forcibly removed from one country to another, and that extends past it. In researching deportation I was faced with the daunting question of how to carry out field research in a setting where there was nothing immediately available to observe and no one identifiable to talk to. Experiencing deportability often renders migrants immobile and invisible. On the one hand, deportable migrants might develop strategies of active invisibility in an effort to avoid authorities. On the other, the increasing use of administrative detention and the criminalisation of immigration offences results in an ever-growing number of foreign nationals under penal or administrative incarceration―sites that are difficult for researchers to access. Furthermore, deportation is a process that spans along time and crosses borders, institutions, and social relations―what <a href="https://www.ethno.uni-freiburg.de/mitarbeiter/wissmit/drotbohm" target="_blank">Heike Drotbohm</a> and myself have termed as the <em><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/deportation-corridor/" target="_blank">deportation corridor</a></em>. In what ways can such a process be grasped in a comprehensive way?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whereas matters of methodology are definitely something to contend with when researching practices and institutions of border control, there are many other challenges to applied research. Access, positionality, informed consent, researching vulnerable populations, are all complicated. So, too, is the emotional burden of scholarly investigation. How do you manage your frustration when you are not granted access to the institution you sought to study? How do you ease your anxiety when the intended subjects of your research refuse to talk to you? What space is there to discuss your ethical dilemmas if you find yourself doing undercover research or have to breach the confidentiality of a respondent? Who can you talk to when you find a research participant was violently killed under custody? What course of action should you take when the people you’ve been interviewing tell you they are suffering from systematic verbal and physical abuse from their ‘caretakers’? Where do you go for help when you feel it is all too much to handle?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" size-full wp-image-4747 alignleft" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/keep-calm-ask-for-peer-support.png" alt="keep-calm-ask-for-peer-support" width="180" height="210" />What may be an obvious answer to someone on the outside may appear as a maze to those who are immersed in a research field that is already emotionally straining. Let’s not forget also that field research can be, and often is, a very isolating and even traumatic experience. The presentations of the EASA panel that I mentioned above showed precisely how often researchers find themselves both wary of revealing to their peers their ethical dilemmas (often in fear of judgement) or ashamed of showing the emotional tension they are going through on account of being systematically exposed to violence, injustice, or the pain of others (see this week’s post by <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/traumatization-helping-ourselves/" target="_blank">Shlomit Weiss-Dagan on secondary traumatization</a>). With an increasing number of researchers focusing on matters of border control, and the social media tools available to us today, there is no need to deal with the pains and frustrations of field research on our own.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is against this backdrop that Border Criminologies has created a forum where these and other related questions may be addressed, free of judgement, by your own peers. It is a place where you can share your experiences, seek advice and support, or simply have your peers hear (or in this case read) what you are going through. We invite you register to the forum and we encourage you to participate in it, either with your own questions or in addressing your peers’ concerns.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Post by Sarah Turnbull, Centre for Criminology, University of Oxford. This post is the <strong>fourth</strong> instalment of the Border Criminologies <strong>Themed Week on Research Methodologies</strong>, organised by <a href="http://www.crim.ox.ac.uk/profile.php?who=mary.bosworth" target="_blank">Prof Mary Bosworth</a>. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Conducting research on immigration detention poses a number of closely entwined methodological and ethical challenges. Among the most pressing are how to build trust among research participants, ensuring independence as a researcher, and communicating across differences of gender, race/ethnicity, language, culture, and religion. Such challenges are compounded by the profound uncertainty, anxiety, and vulnerability that characterises the lived experience of immigration detention. In this post, I explore some of these matters in relation to my experience of drawing keys to undertake fieldwork at four immigration removal centres (IRCs) in the United Kingdom.</p>
<div id="attachment_4735" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-4735 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0069-300x201.jpg" alt="DSC_0069" width="300" height="201" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A sitting area in Alpha Unit, Colnbrook IRC. (Image: Immigration Detention Archive, Border Criminologies)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These reflections are based on the time I spent at Campsfield House, Yarl’s Wood, Colnbrook, and Dover between September 2013 to August 2014. To carry out this fieldwork, I used a mixed-methods approach involving ethnography (i.e., participant observation, interviews, and focus groups) and the administration of a <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/measuring-quality-of-life-immigration-detention/" target="_blank">survey</a>, developed by Mary Bosworth and Blerina Kellezi, that aims to measure the quality of life in detention. I spoke with detained individuals and staff, although most of my interactions were with detainees. The majority of my time was spent in the common areas where the bulk of activities and ‘hanging out’ took place, including the arts and crafts room, games room, library, IT/English room, cultural kitchen, and various spaces for sitting. I also observed a variety of events offered at the centres, including first aid classes, music and art workshops, bingo and other social activities, football matches, and consultative meetings with members of staff and detainee representatives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At each IRC I was granted permission to draw keys and, while following the necessary security protocols, had relatively free access to wander the spaces of the centres. Though undoubtedly institutionally convenient, carrying keys shaped my ability to build relationships of trust with participants and position myself as an independent researcher in quite problematic ways.</p>
<div id="attachment_4733" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-4733 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/A-wardens-bunch-of-keys-in-the-Maze-prison-300x200.jpg" alt="A-wardens-bunch-of-keys-in-the-Maze-prison" width="300" height="200" /><p class="wp-caption-text">(Source: mirror.co.uk)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the outset of the research, I didn’t fully think through the implications of drawing keys. I merely thought that they would enable greater freedom for interaction and observation, reducing the burden on staff who would otherwise act as escorts. As the research proceeded, however, I came to realise my decision was not so straightforward.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the plus side, having keys did allow me greater mobility and thus more freedom to observe and interact with both detainees and staff. I was able to enter and exit the centres based largely on my own schedule. I wasn’t tied to the availability of an escort, a crucial benefit, given the short-staffing I observed at some of the centres. In more practical terms, I could easily move from one space to another to conduct interviews or administer the survey, such as going from the busy arts and crafts room to the more quiet space of the library. This allowed me flexibility to meet with participants in spaces they felt more comfortable, and which allowed for greater privacy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were, however, several downsides to having keys. Building relationships of trust with participants in the stressful, confusing, and uncertain environment of detention is always hard. The fact that I wore keys around my waist raised questions for some about my independence as a researcher, perhaps adding to rumours that I was spying on detainees for the Home Office (for example, see this <a href="https://yethid.wordpress.com/2014/09/11/psychological-weapons-used-against-detainees/" target="_blank">blog post</a> by a former detainee). I often had to explain myself to the women and men. In my experience, having keys combined with my being white to position me as part of the ‘system,’ such as working for Immigration or an NGO providing services in the centre. This is because in most IRCs I attended, my whiteness (and gender) functioned as a type of uniform, aligning me with the primarily white ‘keepers’ in contrast to the non-white ‘kept’―an experience that speaks more broadly to the racialised and gendered nature of immigration detention.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To counter the perception that I worked for Immigration, I’d often wear a University of Oxford sweatshirt or T-shirt in an attempt to (re)assert my identity as an independent, university-based researcher. I also wore a lanyard with my University business card to display when people asked who I was and what I was doing there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among staff, the fact I drew keys also generated confusion. They were not always clear whether I ‘worked’ in the centre and could therefore perform such tasks as escorting detainees who I’d been speaking with back to their units. I would have to explain that I was only given keys to escort <em>myself</em> around the centre.</p>
<div id="attachment_4737" style="width: 211px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-4737 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0017-201x300.jpg" alt="DSC_0017" width="201" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A corridor of Colnbrook IRC&#8217;s short-stay unit. (Image: Immigration Detention Archive, Border Criminologies)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also didn’t realise at the outset how carrying keys would make me feel so uncomfortable. For instance, in Yarl’s Wood’s Hummingbird Unit (the family unit), women were free to associate in the main part of the centre if a member of staff was there to open and secure the door leading into and out of the Unit. Often, women would be waiting, sometimes for 5 to 10 minutes, to get in or out of Hummingbird Unit. I found it awkward to let myself in or out while explaining that I couldn’t open the door for them. It was often easier just to wait with the queue outside of a door, rather than open and lock the door for myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are clearly both methodological benefits and drawbacks to carrying keys to undertake research. In hindsight, I would’ve thought more clearly about the ways in which having keys could impact the research. I would have also given more consideration to how I’d ‘feel’ about, and experience, carrying keys and the sorts of everyday interactions that would be affected by this additional marker of difference between myself as a researcher and those I spoke and interacted with. This, of course, isn’t a new issue; it’s been discussed in the prisons literature and divides people there too. There’s seems to be no easy answer as to whether it’s ethical, or methodologically wise, to carry keys for research in custodial settings.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Trauma can be emotionally contagious. I have experienced it personally. While I was a social worker, I was exposed to many kinds of human trauma, including cases of child abuse. Gradually, the distress I was witnessing at work intruded on my inner, personal sense of security. I only noticed what was happening during a holiday with my family. My father took my nephews to his bed to read stories to them, just as he used to do in my own childhood. As a social worker exposed to many kinds of child abuse, I found myself, walking into my father’s room and checking that ‘everything was fine.’ Needless to say, I had a happy and healthy childhood. My dad looked at me and realized what I was doing. He had huge disappointment in his eyes. Later on, he told me that it was one of the most difficult moments of his life. That was the first time I realized what exposure to trauma can do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4661 size-full" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/word-cloud.jpg" alt="word cloud" width="1792" height="1289" />There are two main kinds of secondary trauma: ‘Secondary Traumatization Syndrome’ and ‘Vicarious Traumatization.’ The personal experience I described above is analogous to Vicarious Traumatization, in which, upon repeated exposure to the suffering of others, a person may experience alterations to their inner world view or cognitive schemes, as well as the inability to build intimate relationships based on confidence and trust. Their sense of self-perception and self-mastery become distorted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another form of secondary trauma is known as ‘Secondary Traumatization Syndrome.’ Equivalent to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), this response can occur as a result of experiencing a traumatic event, threat of death or physical injury in which a person felt helpless and deeply in fear. The symptoms of PTSD are generally divided into three categories: intrusive memories (flashbacks, nightmares, recurrent distressing memories, etc.); avoidance (trying to avoid anything that can provoke the trauma memory, e.g., avoiding places or talking about the traumatic event); and changes in emotional reactions (trouble sleeping and concentrating, etc.). Secondary trauma and vicarious traumatization symptoms mimic those of PTSD making it harder to acknowledge it and treat it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you find yourself, upon exposure to the pain of others, trying to avoid remembering shady details of it, reliving the traumatic event, or experiencing severe emotional distress, then you are probably experiencing secondary traumatization. It is important to realize that this is a natural consequence. It is human. Secondary traumatization and subsequent emotional distress flow from to our empathic engagement with the pain of the other.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The obvious question is what we can do about it? How can we become more resilient while we are exposed to suffering and nauseating details of distressful material during our professional or research work. In my own work, as in other others, I found that special training, social and organizational support, and even psychotherapy were helpful. Education on the impact of secondary traumatic stress makes people more aware of the symptoms and emotional reactions. On an organizational level, additional supervision that can encourage emotional processing can be very helpful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although dealing with trauma survivors is difficult, the emotions we endure are also a reminder of the importance of that task. Dealing with pain is not only risky, but it can at the same time be beneficial and encourage our personal growth. It can strengthen our emotional resilience for the future while assisting us in responding to those we work with or seek to understand.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Forced return in Sweden is characterized by heavy politicization, systemic fragmentation and is shrouded in a veil of securitization. Forced return is both an organized activity, with different state and non-state authorities involved, and an activity that seeks to end a relationship of responsibility between the state and the non-citizen. The forced return migration process is generally not conceptualised as a comprehensive process by policy-makers or practitioners but rather as a loosely linked series of activities that eventually lead to the return of the migrant. This is possibly due to the disparate institutional actors involved. For migrants however, the actual “end threat” of removal to their country of origin is very real and hangs like a dark shadow on their existence for as long as they hold temporary permits of residence. This dark shadow of deportation takes on new and tangible proportions through the institutional forms and practices that migrants, who have either failed their application for asylum or who have no other lawful permit to remain in the country, encounter. Our project attempts to start filling a knowledge gap by exploring migrants’ own experiences of this particular forced return process conceptualised as a social, cultural and political phenomenon. Access and contact with migrants is therefore of utmost importance to our project.</p>
<div id="attachment_4759" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-4759 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1017-300x95.jpg" alt="IMG_1017" width="300" height="95" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Migrant Detention Centre, Kållered</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original plan at the start of this 18-month project was to first obtain access to one or more of Sweden’s five immigration detention centres where we would spend time, through regular visits, with migrants at risk of deportation. This would have enabled regular contact with migrants since we were aware that meeting migrants at risk of deportation out in the community would be very difficult. Indeed, as our own study came to confirm, in Sweden migrants at risk of deportation out in the community are difficult to identify since they (understandably) do not share widely their legal status, partly to avoid stigma, but mostly because it increases their precariousness in various settings. We now know that migrants, particularly those who do not opt for voluntary return, take time to or even refuse to consider the real eventuality of return, and therefore would also not identify themselves as potential deportees.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second part of our original strategy was to seek the collaboration of entities who are regularly in touch with migrants at risk of deportation―institutional entities such as the police, non-governmental organisations who offer services to migrants, including those at risk of deportation, and activist organisations whom migrants contact for help usually as a last resort. This strategy would have neatly given us several points of access and contact with migrants, it would have allowed us to carry out ethnographic research in various settings and sites, and would therefore have made it possible for us to capture elements and patterns in migrants’ experiences of forced return.</p>
<div id="attachment_4760" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-4760 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1660-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_1660" width="300" height="225" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Migrant Detention Centre, Åstorp</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, neat strategies on paper seldom work out as planned in irregular migrant settings, and ours was no exception. As a research group, and based on our previous experiences in conducting research with migrants, we expected challenges but thought we were well-prepared. We had spent time discussing alternative strategies, and possible problems that could arise from institutions who fear scrutiny. So how did we end up in a situation, which could possibly only be described as “internalized stalemate”? In other words, why did we―the researchers―ended up in a situation where we felt immobilized, afraid to take initiative and under attack from every angle? What was the cause of our troubles? And how could we minimize the impact that these struggles are bound to have on the research that we were conducting, and on the production of knowledge?</p>
<div id="attachment_4761" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1019.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4761 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1019-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_1019" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Visiting room, Migrant Detention Centre, Kållered</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The simplest answer to the above questions is that we, both as researchers and persons, were often caught in crossfire(s). The highly politicized nature of the field, broadly understood as the various institutions, service/providers and NGOs, meant that we were questioned and subject to scrutiny ourselves not just as researchers but also from a moral aspect, as persons. The field is imbued with front lines. One of the most apparent is the contrasting ideologies. For example, authorities, such as the Border Police and the Migration Board (responsible for running detention centres) have very little in common with activist networks. Differences in ideology, morality and political tendencies were evidenced in the use of different terminology. As researchers one of our first hurdles was to learn how to navigate these different language/terminology-groups in an attempt to avoid being labelled. At a later stage we were familiar enough with the different terminologies to use them intentionally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Surprisingly although the entities we encountered in the beginning of our project were of a very different nature, we were often met with similar responses. For example, many times our phone calls and e-mails were met with silence and no replies. We found it hard to interpret the lack of communication: was it due to lack of time, or did they simply not want to be in touch with us, and if so, why was this? Persistence is one of the sacred traits of researchers. But when we did manage to get in touch we often found that the interactions were imbued with suspicion and distrust, at times leading to sudden changes in their attitudes, which we found hard to understand. A classic example was when we established what we thought was a clear contact and an uncomplicated interaction, with one of the gatekeeper institutions, which would enable us to obtain regular contact with migrants. The tables turned very quickly when someone in the institution requested our original research plan. We were then denied access for “having too many faults and unclarities in our research plan.” The communication with us was stopped and the institution contacted the funding agency with the complaints. Complaints which were ambiguous and far from clear to say the least. Various attempts were made by us and by the funding agency (which is also a government entity) to try to get to the bottom of this, in a genuine bid to understand the problem. After several unsuccessful efforts to establish dialogue over a six week period we decided to drop it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" size-full wp-image-4743 alignleft" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/EuropeanREtunrFund.jpg" alt="EuropeanREtunrFund" width="263" height="237" />Another example of being met with distrust and suspicion came from the NGO side, where we had some prior contacts and had established, again what we thought was, a good relationship. In fact we were invited to spend time in their facilities, which migrants use to relax and to get in touch with the NGO for help. In this case we were wrongly accused of omitting information about where the funding was coming from. The European Return Fund is linked to the EU Return Directive and this civil organisation had a strong ideological position against both. Accusations flew high and low. Our morality and integrity as researchers and persons were put into question. Attempts to break through this impasse left us in a state of frustration, despair and confusion. It seemed impossible for anyone to understand that we genuinely wanted to understand how migrants experience the forced return process. We did not have ulterior political motives and did not want to align ourselves with any of the actors. Irrespective of this we were constantly labelled, re-labelled, positioned and re-positioned by the different actors themselves. The common motive, or least outcome of this, was that we were excluded from the field and contact with migrants was made directly or indirectly extremely difficult.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rays of light kept us going in the difficult periods. We had a few contacts, often individual and undercover, who were extremely helpful. Slowly new doors opened here and there as people of different affiliations and institutions agreed to help us in significant ways. Although to be honest, it was and still is, quite hard to really understand why some contacts worked and others did not.  A possible explanation in our attempts to understand and make sense of our interactions with different gatekeepers or middlemen are Bourdieu’s concepts of the ‘field’ and ‘symbolic capital.’ This field of activity of deportation is clearly not homogenous, and practices that are connected to different fields (bureaucracies such as the police and the Migration Board, activist groups, voluntary organisations) have their own separate rules of access and power structures. The researcher thus requires different symbolic capital to gain trust and legitimacy in these different fields. From this point of view, although this of course is only a part explanation of what was going on, we, the three researchers, lacked enough symbolic capital in these different gatekeeping fields to enable us to access them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are aware that our frustration is coming from trying to establish contact or fruitful interaction with gatekeepers, when the people we really wanted to meet, the migrants, were ironically the easiest to speak to. Reaching the migrants meant that we needed to change our original strategy. We worked hard with the principle of “the strength of weak ties” made popular by several anthropologists and social network analysts, and we spent time at places that accommodate migrants at risk of deportation and circulated information posters about the project. Needless to say, trying to map the field and getting in touch with migrants was an extremely time consuming, tedious and gruelling business. In itself however, and this is where methodological self-reflexivity for the researcher turned out to be critical for our project, we did gain a lot of insights about the institutional and political forces that shape this field. We also understood that, when doing research in a field like this, the way researchers are perceived by others may have little to do what they actually say or do, and that researchers may have few or no real means to control this process.</p>
