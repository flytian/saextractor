The model combines online crowdsourcing with audience engagement activities to create a collection of stories and digital objects (images, audio, text, etc). It has been successfully used for projects such as the Great War Archive, Woruldhord, Europeana1914-1918 and Europeana1989. In the course, you will learn about the model and how to implement it for your community collection. You will get an opportunity to set up your own collection platform and discuss how to engage your community.</p>

Working as an aggregator of data in different media formats, as well as a powerful data visualisation platform, MAPP enables its users to make sense out of diffused and partial bits of information. Mainly developed as a front-end visualisation tool, MAPP provides access not only to the granular details of each singular event in a given dataset, but also, through interactive graphs and charts, it allows for temporal and spatial trends to be revealed. A participatory tool, currently at proof of concept stage, MAPP is being developed by the research cluster Forensic Architecture (Goldsmiths, University of London), in partnership with Amnesty International.</p>

In this talk, we will demonstrate how we sketched out initial results using visualization techniques, and how we carried out the evaluation process at the different stages of the application development. Poem Viewer has provides scholars with a tool to examine 26 different poetic attributes with the ability to make “moment-by-moment choices” as they explore the visualizations. Using a scientific jargon, scholars can now perform “multivariate data analysis” during close reading.</p>

	  <p class="catCourseSumm">This course takes you through the steps required to create a good relational database design from concept to implementation. A relational database is one where data is organised into tables by subject, related by common fields. Before even starting to build, it is essential to work out a design which properly models your project. You will learn to analyse scenarios, choosing suitable fields where data can be stored. You will learn the principles of good design for a database. You will consider why fields should be organised into separate tables, and how they can be related. You will look at different kinds of relationships (joins) and when to use them. The course includes plenty of worked examples and practice activities. The course does not use any particular software, so it will help you create a well-designed database structure which you can build later using the database software of your choice. </p>

	  <p class="catCourseSumm">This one day workshop outlines the challenges and opportunities of ePublication and multi-touch book creation and will show examples of interactive or multi–touch illustrations. InDesign will primarily be used in the practical elements of the workshop which will include creating a document using style sheets and master pages and then adding images and interactive or multi–touch elements to the document. The Alternative Layout for iPad controls found in newer versions of InDesign will also be reviewed.  The final part of the workshop involves reviewing publications using Adobe Content Viewer.

	  <p class="catCourseSumm">With the investment in web content and design constantly growing, marketing and comms people want to be able to understand and track what visitors are interacting with, reading and watching.  Historically this has been done by adding JavaScript code snippets to web pages which has been a barrier to success. Google Tag Manager has been developed by Google to make the management of this more secure, easier and faster. During this half-day overview, we will share the benefits of using Google Tag Manager to better understand how visitors are interacting with your website and content. The course will cover what Google Tag Manager is, how it extends Google Analytics, example configurations and how to implement it on your website.  </p>

They have been around for 20 years inspired by Alan Kay who described them as a new kind of literacy, combining a written essay, live simulations, and the programs that make them work.  A good example is the Parable of the Polygons (http://ncase.me/polygons/) and  a more technical example is Up and down the abstraction ladder  http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/.  Come along to this session presented by Ken Kahn and learn more about this exciting approach to sharing knowledge.</p>

By appealing equally to the principles of design, Zen simplicity, and the art of story telling,  Garr Reynolds will share an approach that leads to compelling visual presentations that stay in the memory. Garr will discuss narrative and the visual design strategies that clarify the role of the presenter and the presentation, giving a cohesive  overview of how they interact.  Those of you who have seen Garr's previous presentations will know they are in for an entertaining and informative hour. </p>

	  <p class="catCourseSumm">This three hour session has two parts. The first part is a discussion and talk about poster design. This emphasises how the design process should be approached in PowerPoint, but there is much that is also applicable in other tools. The second part is a workshop where you are encouraged to bring along your own resources and start to create your own poster in PowerPoint 2010. If you are not yet ready to do this, there will be resources available that you can use to create a practice poster.</p>

	  <p class="catCourseSumm">This course covers many of the most commonly used and most useful commands for more complex (and more realistic) data manipulation and analysis. Some previous experience of Stata is necessary - equivalent to "Stata: Introduction to data access and management". Participants will be guided to work in .do files, and will be expected to follow closely and replicate the work of the Stata instructor.</p>

How to perform common statistical analyses is also covered, although the emphasis is on the Stata commands and interpretation of output rather than on teaching statistics. The previous two Stata courses would be a good starting base, however broader statistical and methodological knowledge is also expected.</p>

	  <p class="catCourseSumm">This is a statistical concepts course, an ideas course, a think-in-pictures course.  What are the basic notions and constructs of statistics?  Why do we differentiate between a population and a sample?  How do we summarise and describe sample information?  Why, and how, do we compare data with expectations?  How do hypotheses arise and how do we set about testing them?  With inherent uncertainty in any sample, how can one extrapolate from a sample to the population?  And then, how strong are our conclusions? This course is designed to prepare you to get the most from the statistical applications that we teach. It involves discussion of real-life examples and interpretation of data. We strive to avoid mathematical symbols, notation and formulae.</p>

XPath (XML Path Language) is a query notation language for selecting nodes in a XML document. XPath is used as a search language in various XML querying and processing languages such as XSLT and XQuery. It enables you to search or match various parts of some source XML and then, depending on the context, do something with them in that processing language. The course will give you a chance to practice using XPath to search an XML file in the oXygen XML Editor.
