               [28] My name is Aled Pierce  and I was born in the   [...] on November the eighth nineteen ten.<br>
               [29] And er my mother Janet Hughes  was a s sister to Mrs Jonathan   [...] .<br>
               [30] And Jonathan  was justice of the peace and quite a leader in   [...] ar area.<br>
               [31] After my father's death in twenty three, he was executive of the estate and my guardian.<br>
               [32] Co-guardian with my mother.<br>
               [33] So I have close contact with the    [...] family from from my childhood.<br>
               [34] And anyway erm I first went to  and the money ran out and so  Grammar School, and then er I was transferred to PorthMadog County School where er Jonathan  at that time was chairman of the board of governors.<br>
               [35] And after some slight difficulty I wasn't a very good student, er I finished early before There was no chance of my passing matric anyway.<br>
               [36] It would have been a w waste of time.<br>
               [37] So I became er an office boy at  Brothers.<br>
               [38] By this time they had purchased a building which had been I think a a bank or a savings bank or something at  Street in Porthmadog.<br>
               [39] And that's where I served as an office boy, kind of a a latter day Bob Cratchitt.<br></td>

               [84] That if you send Number one you should never use any messenger unless the messenger is trustworthy.<br>
               [85] And naturally you expect a member of our own family to be trustworthy.<br>
               [86] Therefore, he said, you're to show your trust in the messenger, you never seal the envelope.<br>
               [87] Then the receiver would know that this was a trustworthy messenger and could treat you accordingly.<br>
               [88] Now, he said, if there's any question of doubt, he'll seal it and then the receiver would know there was some question of doubt, and he would seal back the reply.<br>
               [89] But if it came unopened, unsealed, he would return the reply unsealed.<br>
               [90] He said, That is a showing that people are honest.<br>

               [513] Well he was my my mother's first cousin you see.<br>
               [514] So he invited her sent her a ticket to come to America for a year in nineteen three.<br>
               [515] But my grandmother was an old victorian, my mother would not   [...] then insisted that she have a chaperon, so Mrs Jonathan , Auntie Bessie, went with her.<br>
               [516] But er according to my mother's great joy, she got seasick even on the landing stage in in Liverpool and never came out of her cabin, so she had a big time as a young women running around the ship.<br>
               [517] And old man Heinz of Heinz fifty seven varieties, they were a big time, and gave her a little silver pickle with Heinz on it.<br>
               [518]  [...] sterling silver, and I've still got it.<br>
               [519]  [laugh] But anyway, she went to so she had she she wasn't she'd been very pro American until I decided I was gonna emigrate.<br>
               [520] But anyway, she made me promise that my first day in New York, I'd go to   ... Statue of Liberty.<br>
               [521] Now Statue of Liberty of course is in in the news.<br>
               [522] And when I was when I got to New York, I was met by two first cousins from two different families er Bert  who's er er nephew of my my mother's sister Laura Anne in in New York, and another one, William  who'd been very successful   [...] vice president of   [...] or something.<br>
               [523] So anyway, erm they met me and Bert had to go back to his office and Will said he had to go back to his office, but he said, What would you like to do?<br>
               [524] I said I'd like to go see the Statue of Liberty, I promised my mother I would.<br>
               [525] Well he said, Alright, he said, ... I've made arrangements for your baggage to be picked up and you'll stay with me in New Rochelle, and he was going away and he slipped me ten bucks cos I only had ten pounds money.<br>
               [526] And he said, here's a cab, and you tell this cab driver where you want to go.<br>
               [527] So I had no idea where this place was, I knew where it was at the chart but I didn't know where it was from from pier fifty four in New York.<br>
               [528] Cunard Pier.<br>
               [529] So I got aboard this cab, and the guy said, Buddy where do you want to go to?<br>
               [530] And I didn't know what this buddy meant?<br>
               [531] And I said, I want to go to   [...] 's Island.<br>
               [532] He said, Where?<br>
               [533] And I said, [...] 's Island.<br>
               [534] He said, Never heard of it.<br>
               [535] I said, Obviously you haven't read the chart, that's where the Statue of Liberty is, on   [...] 's Island.<br>
               [536] Cos I had studied the chart to k know something about er and I I presume I was one of the few people in New York, who knew the damn thing was on   [...] 's Island you see.<br>
               [537] Anyway I went there and I was impressed, I'd seen it from the ship and I completely concur with everything that's been said.<br>
               [538] How all those immigrants and children of immigrants, that the Statue of Liberty, means a great deal to those Americans who whose parents or who came themselves from another country.<br>
               [539] Now I wasn't coming I wasn't a refugee from anything except unemployment.<br>
               [540] But erm er the on that ship I remember we stopped at Queenstown  [...] .<br>
               [541] And I remember a whole boat-load of these young Irish lads and lasses coming aboard you know, weeping and wailing.<br>
               [542] And there was a guy with one arm, [...] and saying, you know, Come ye back to Ireland.<br>
               [543] You know.<br>
               [544] very moving but we had a big big time and of course when you're eighteen, er it'd be an adventure.<br>
               [545] And of course er I knew something about America, my mother had been there and er we had some c I had eighteen first cousins in America when I went there.<br>
               [546] But anyway, my job was to go out to Toledo.<br>
               [547] And stopped on the way of course in  [...] .<br>
               [548] And they tell the story you know about the Welshman from   [...] or erm   [...] or somewhere, emigrating to America and heard about   [...] all his life as being the great Welsh centre.<br>
               [549] And we got to New York  [...] .<br>
