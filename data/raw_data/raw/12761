			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Caroline_Parker2" target="_blank">Caroline Parker</a>, doctoral student in the Department of Sociomedical Sciences/Anthropology at Columbia University. </em></p>
<p>Review of <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/Life-Interrupted/" target="_blank"><em>Life Interrupted: Trafficking into Forced Labor in the United States</em>,</a> by Denise Brennan (Duke University Press, 2014).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/Life-Interrupted/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5636" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/LifeInterrupted-200x300.jpg" alt="LifeInterrupted" width="200" height="300" /></a>Denise Brennan’s lucid and meticulously researched investigation of human trafficking in the United States adeptly accomplishes many of the ambitions of engaged anthropological inquiry. She brings to life, with technical expertise, political commitment and stringent clarity, the daily grind―the ‘making ends meet’―of a group of women who were formerly trafficked. Renouncing the sensationalist simplifications that continue to plague popular discourse on human trafficking, her moral project is a re-humanizing one, appreciable from the opening line of the book, <em>Maria Loves to Sing</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the outset, Brennan makes it clear that there’s no single, archetypical, obviously recognizable trafficked person―<a href="http://www.vice.com/read/flight-attendants-launch-app-to-track-human-trafficking-reports-789" target="_blank">which is bad news for recent app-innovations, such as the flight attendant app, for photographing people who ‘look’ like they&#8217;ve been trafficked</a>. Her informants come from diverse geographical places and disparate social standings. The different life experiences that the main characters bring with them to the US, along with the varying conditions of their trafficking situations, powerfully illustrate the illegibility of ‘trafficking victims’ as a recognizable social kind. One of the book’s earliest messages―and an important one for practitioners―is that migrants who are trafficked look a lot like other migrants. One informant, Angela, a green card holder and legal resident, had lived on the East Coast for over a decade when she decided to take a chance on a job in childcare in Texas. Immediately she entered into a situation of labor exploitation, working seven days a week for $250. Despite her ten years of experience in the United States and having a large network of friends, she didn’t immediately leave her traffickers, for fear that they’d make good on their threat to have her green card revoked. As an English-speaking legal resident, trafficked into childcare rather than sex work, Angela doesn’t fit the stereotype of a trafficking victim. Brennan emphasizes that few people do; many initially contact social services because of other issues (domestic violence, legal assistance, etc.), and, as one New York social worker quoted explains, ‘They do not come to us talking about trafficking’ (p. 111). This unrecognizability of people who are trafficked poses serious problems for anti-trafficking programs, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1rxnYu7tV0" target="_blank">recent UNODC campaigns</a>, that call on the general public to ‘wake-up’ to and recognize victims of trafficking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brennan’s overarching intellectual goal is to contextualize human trafficking within its global political economy and to show that the thing we call human trafficking is a tiny part of a much larger global regime of labor exploitation. The book is split into two parts. Part I, ‘The Assault on Workers,’ documents the widespread exploitation of migrant labor and provides the book’s theoretical and political argument. Anti-immigrant policies and practices such as workplace raids and ‘secure communities’ programs (see pp. 41-48) increase vulnerability to labor exploitation among undocumented workers. Immigration policy combined with unregulated labor conditions, greatly facilitated by extensive sub-contracting and unchecked employer control, together erode employer responsibility, and push many migrants into situations that are ‘almost trafficking’ (p. 40). Working below minimum wage in garment manufacturing, agriculture, poultry processing, restaurants, and domestic work, migrant workers often endure egregious physical injury and abuse. Brennan argues that human trafficking is ‘migration gone awry’ (p. 6), and may be seen as a logical consequence and necessary correlate of anti-immigrant policies and lax labor laws in the United States. Within this global regime of labor exploitation, only a small minority will qualify for T-visas, which is the legally recognized status as ‘trafficking victims.’ Recipients of T-visas are entitled them to remain in the US for three years, at which time they may apply for permanent residency. As Brennan shows, T-visas aren’t given out for ‘a little bit of exploitation’ (p. 11). While exact figures are hard to come by, Brennan calculates that roughly 3,500 T-visas have been issued since 2002, which is significantly lower than the 14,500-17,500 persons estimated by the US government to work in forced labor conditions in the United States (pp. 200-201).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In book’s second chapter, Brennan explores why it is that people ‘choose’ to stay with their traffickers. As we learn, most of her informants were not physically forced to stay with their traffickers; not one of them was found ‘chained to a bed in a brothel,’ as phrased by <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=984927" target="_blank">Dina Francesca Haynes</a>. This chapter is ethnographically rich and perhaps the most theoretically animated, and she draws upon Lila Abu-Lughod, James Scott, and Steven Lukes (pp. 82-87) to show that what can appear to be acquiescence to subjugation may more accurately be interpreted as a waiting game, in which people who are trafficked stall, plot, and strategize their escape. Brennan’s attention to agency and subjectivity adds nuance to psychological-trauma based explanations of why people stay with their traffickers, which, while not totally incorrect, can often be inattentive to the social and political context in which non-violent forms of coercion occur. Many people in situations of trafficking believe they will be arrested and deported should they leave their traffickers, which isn’t, of course, an unreasonable assumption―something to which traffickers (and also exploitative employers) are highly attuned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Part II, ‘Life after Forced Labor,’ follows her informants as they begin the long and protracted process of building a life (or gaining ‘home-sense’) in the US. The focus on life <em>after </em>trafficking represents a key empirical contribution to the trafficking literature. While accounts of trafficking are often biased towards focusing on the melodrama of abuse, escape, and rescue (see work by <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.5406/historypresent.2.2.0200?uid=32111&amp;uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3&amp;uid=32104&amp;uid=5910784&amp;uid=67&amp;uid=62&amp;sid=21106376314391" target="_blank">Carol Vance</a> for a discussion of this), Brennan ‘picks up where these sensationalistic accounts leave off’ (p. 4), and deals with the more mundane aspects of life after trafficking. She follows her informants as they move from shelters into private homes, find work (and sometimes lose it again), fall in love, learn English, and negotiate all of the other ‘nuts and bolts’ of adjusting to life in a new country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A sobering and lesser-known fact about life after trafficking: most government assistance granted to T-visa recipients is suspended after about one year (p. 116), meaning that people have limited time to ‘resettle.’ The first year is thus often spent finding work, taking English language classes, and securing housing. Although ‘recovery’ is the language of anti-trafficking services, and although many T-visa grantees find themselves inundated (at least for the first year) with offers of mental health counseling and psychological therapy, according to the exasperated social workers and case managers that she interviews, many don’t want therapy. The most immediate material challenges that formerly trafficked people face are in finding work and housing. With limited time to resettle before government benefits (including free mental health services) run out, ‘making ends meet’ is an enormous challenge. According the Brennan, this language of ‘trauma’ and the emphasis on ‘recovery’ miss the point. The challenges that formerly trafficked people face are much like those of other poor migrants, and even other poor Americans, making formerly trafficked people distinct largely only in their relative social isolation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the saddest elements of the book was the re-entry of formerly trafficked people into situations of labor exploitation. Undermined by the same vulnerabilities that led them into trafficking in the first place, their lack of education and English language skills mean that many end up following co-ethnics back into insecure and under-regulated labor sects. Their unwavering determination to find work means that many formerly trafficked people re-enter situations of labor exploitation, and go on to accept jobs which pay below minimum wage, as revealed in this quote by one social worker from California: <em>‘We tell them this is not legal and that these are sweatshops and exploitative conditions. They go to places like restaurants and get paid under the table. It’s a dilemma. But they see their larger community of co-ethnics is in the same situation’</em> (p. 178).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Life Interrupted</em> is carefully written and commendably well researched. Although her moral and intellectual project is manifest throughout the book, Brennan often takes a back seat and allows her informants to do the talking. This allows her to relate insights from differently situated social informants, and brings to light the multiple differences and contradictions in perspectives of formerly trafficked people and those that work with them. Her inclination to give voice to her informants and to privilege clarity and accessibility speaks to her political intervention as an engaged anthropologist. Royalties of the book are donated to a nonprofit (Survivor Leadership Training Fund), and the book ends with an appendix, ‘Ideas and Resources for Action’ (pp. 193-198), in which with immigration reform and workers rights are paramount.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by Jasmina Nogo, an attorney and recent graduate of the North Carolina Central University School of Law. In her legal practice Jasmina has served low-income communities in North Carolina facing obstacles in immigration, education, domestic violence, and housing. Prior to becoming a lawyer she worked as a social worker and community organizer with Latino/a communities facing hardships due to their immigration status. Jasmina plans to continue advocating for immigrants in the United States incorporating legal advocacy and social work into her practice.</em><em> This post is the third installment of the Border Criminologies <em><strong>Themed Week on Migration, Criminal Law</strong></em><em><strong> and Criminal Justice</strong></em></em><em> organised by <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/people/anaaliverti/" target="_blank">Ana Aliverti</a>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5794" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2-300x173.jpg" alt="2" width="300" height="173" />‘Alberto’ was only sixteen years old when he was arrested for participating in an attempted robbery with two other children. The prosecution dropped charges against the young man who planned the robbery in exchange for his testimony against the other two. The second boy was sentenced to six months in a juvenile detention facility. Alberto was transferred to adult court where he was convicted and sentenced to serve time in adult prison until he turned twenty-eight. Upon release he was immediately moved to immigration custody and deported back to Honduras, a country he hadn’t been to since he was four years old. ‘Amira’ was brought to the United States by her parents when she was two years old from a small nation in the Middle East. At the age of seventeen, Amira was involved as an aggressor in a fight with a peer. She was arrested and charged with aggravated assault in the juvenile justice system. Her defense attorney advised her to <em>voluntarily </em>waive juvenile jurisdiction. However, she wasn’t advised about the immigration consequences of the voluntary waiver to adult court and of her subsequent plea, which led to her almost being deported. As soon as she completed her sentence, Amira was snatched by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and placed into deportation proceedings. Her adult conviction automatically led to an immigration detainer. She was to face the proceeding alone, as neither her juvenile defender nor public defender had any remaining legal obligation towards her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each year in the United States, an estimated 200,000 children under the age of eighteen are tried as adults. While juvenile dispositions don’t constitute criminal convictions and therefore don’t carry immigration consequences, if the child is transferred to adult court, the conviction will count as a conviction for immigration purposes―as seen in the above cases of Alberto and Amira. Additionally, although the child is appointed a state defender in criminal court, he or she is <em>not </em>entitled to counsel in immigration court, even though the government is always represented by a lawyer. Therefore, children are forced to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/us/more-young-illegal-immigrants-face-deportation.html?pagewanted&amp;_r=2" target="_blank">represent themselves in deportation proceedings</a> that are often more complex and more serious than most juvenile delinquency cases. A failure to provide government-appointed counsel in the immigration proceeding may be a violation of the minors’ due process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Additionally, the failure of a juvenile defender to adequately advise the child about the collateral consequences associated with the transfer violates the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in <em><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-651.ZS.html" target="_blank">Padilla v. Kentucky</a></em>, where the Court held that criminal defense attorneys must advise non-citizen clients about the deportation risks of a guilty plea.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-5795 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1-300x256.jpg" alt="EPSON scanner image" width="300" height="256" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under the US Constitution’s Due Process Clause, the government has a duty to provide children facing juvenile delinquency charges with legal representation. The Constitution, therefore, guarantees children this safeguard notwithstanding the civil, rather than criminal, character of juvenile delinquency proceedings. The Supreme Court based its justification for a right to counsel in juvenile proceedings on the risk of incarceration and the deprivation of liberty that result from an adjudication of delinquency. Similarly, in immigration proceedings resulting from a juvenile transfer to the adult courts, a child may face prolonged immigration detention―for instance, 32% of immigrants in ICE detention spend between thirty and sixty days in detention―and <a href="http://www.latinpost.com/articles/41585/20150309/7k-immigrant-children-deported-without-court-appearance.htm" target="_blank">deportation to their country of origin</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to government-appointed counsel in deportation proceedings, the duties mandated by <em>Padilla </em>should extend to the juvenile transfer process. Under <em>Padilla</em>, defense attorneys must inform their clients whether their pleas carry even a risk of deportation. The Court recognized that changes in immigration law over the last fifty years have dramatically raised the stakes of a noncitizen’s criminal conviction and that <em>‘deportation is an integral part―indeed, sometimes the most important part―of the penalty that may be imposed on non citizen defendants who plead guilty to specified crimes.’</em> The Court recognized that although removal proceedings are civil in nature, deportation is nevertheless intimately related to the criminal process. Undocumented children convicted of adult crimes descend into the immigration pipeline and then fall through the cracks of the immigration system. Meanwhile, nothing in the system protects them or allows their voices to be meaningfully heard in court. These children are particularly vulnerable and the precariousness of their immigration status must be taken into account when considering their transfer into the adult criminal justice system. Furthermore, they must be provided legal counsel to represent them in immigration court and seek relief from deportation. Anything short of that is an egregious violation of international human rights practices and sets the United States apart from the rest of the world.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Post by <a href="http://www.law.uci.edu/faculty/full-time/chacon/" target="_blank">Jennifer M. Chacón</a>, Professor of Law, University of California, Irvine School of Law. </em><em>This post is the first installment of the Border Criminologies </em><em><strong>Themed Week on Migration, Criminal Law</strong><em><strong> and Criminal Justice</strong></em> organised by <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/people/anaaliverti/" target="_blank">Ana Aliverti</a>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the 1990s, Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, came to prominence on the national scene. Given recent political and legal developments, one might guess that he initially drew attention to himself through policies and practices aimed at targeting unauthorized migrants in his jurisdiction. In fact, in his early years as sheriff, Sheriff Arpaio wasn’t particularly concerned with the issue of unauthorized migration. Instead, he was known for his harsh approach toward those convicted of crimes. He became famous for his rough treatment of prisoners: his high-profile efforts to both reify gender hierarchy and exploit it by requiring male inmates to parade publically from one penal institution to another wearing pink underwear, his creation of tent prisons without air conditioning in a region that routinely has temperatures in excess of 40 degrees Celsius in the summer months, and his relentless <a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/09/27/americas-toughest-sheriff-takes-meat-off-jail-menu/" target="_blank">efforts</a> to cut the cost of food in jails by cutting out luxuries like salt, pepper, and―more recently―meat. He has proudly proclaimed himself ‘America’s toughest sheriff.’</p>
<div id="attachment_5786" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5786" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2013-01-09t232020z_1587493179_tm4e9191e1301_rtrmadp_3_usa-shooting-300x200.jpg" alt="Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio  (Photo: REUTERS/Laura Segall)" width="300" height="200" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio (Photo: REUTERS/Laura Segall)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More recently, however, Sheriff Arpaio has discovered that unauthorized migrants are another worthy target of his energies. In this, he’s been aided by the voters of Arizona. Over the past decade―and particularly in the period from 2005 to 2010―Arizona voters have supported a number of bills and ballot initiatives aimed at facilitating the identification and removal (or the ‘self-deportation’) of unauthorized migrants in the state. Litigation over two of these measures reached the US Supreme Court in recent years. In 2011, for instance, the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/supreme-court-upholds-legal-arizona-workers-act-limited-implications-other-state-immigration" target="_blank">upheld</a> the Legal Arizona Workers Act (LAWA) which authorized the state to revoke the state-issued business licenses of employers that failed to verify the legal status of their employees. In 2012, the Supreme Court heard <a href="http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/062512_sb1070_scotus/supreme-court-strikes-down-most-sb-1070-provisions/" target="_blank">a challenge to S.B. 1070</a>―a law with criminal and civil law provisions ‘<a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070p.htm" target="_blank">intended to work together to discourage and deter the unlawful entry and presence of aliens and economic activity by persons unlawfully present in the United States</a>.’ The Supreme Court struck down several key components of S.B. 1070 on the ground that they were preempted by federal immigration law. In deciding the 2012 case―<a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/arizona-v-united-states/" target="_blank"><em>US v. Arizona</em></a>―the Supreme Court reiterated the legal principle that the US federal government has the sole power to enact and enforce immigration laws, and that the states cannot enact laws aimed to supplement or conflict with federal immigration law and policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This past year, the Supreme Court was asked once again to assess the legality of an Arizona law targeting unauthorized migrants. On 1 June 2015, the Court declined to hear an appeal from a decision by an eleven judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2014/10/15/11-16487.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Lopez-Valenzuela v. Arpaio</em></a>. The case should be of interest to readers of this blog because it squarely speaks to issues involving non-citizens in the US criminal justice system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Lopez-Valenzuela</em> involved a challenge to Arizona’s Proposition 100, a law enacted by popular ballot initiative in 2006 that required the categorical denial of bail ‘for serious felony offenses as prescribed by the legislature if the person charged has entered or remained in the United States illegally and if the proof is evident or the presumption great as to the present change.’ Under the law, unauthorized migrants charged with certain felonies would be denied bail automatically, even when similarly situated citizens or lawful permanent residents could receive bail. The initiative highlights the confluence of the harshly punitive elements of what Professor Mona Lynch (who has studied Arizona criminal justice policy extensively) has termed ‘<a href="http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=17521" target="_blank">sunbelt justice</a>’ with the criminalization of migration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-5790 alignleft" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/action_nationalsecurity-300x216.jpg" alt="action_nationalsecurity" width="300" height="216" />In a decision filed on 15 October 2014, the Ninth Circuit ruled that Proposition 100 violates non-citizens due process rights because the deprivation of liberty in criminal proceedings requires an individualized determination that a person poses a flight risk or danger to the community. While the Ninth Circuit acknowledged that categorical analyses could be employed in making such determinations, it found that <em>‘the record contains no findings, studies, statistics or other evidence… showing that undocumented immigrants as a group pose either an unmanageable flight risk or a significantly greater flight risk than lawful residents.’</em> By denying <em><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/certiorari" target="_blank">certiorari</a></em>, the Supreme Court renders the Ninth Circuit decision the last word on the issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The<em> Lopez-Valenzuela</em> case put to rest one attempt to legalize the differential treatment of unauthorized migrants in the criminal justice system, but this denial of <em>cert</em> doesn’t mean, as a practical matter, that immigration status is irrelevant in criminal proceedings in the US. A <a href="http://www.asanet.org/journals/ASR/Oct14ASRFeature.pdf" target="_blank">recent empirical study</a> by Michael Light and others, published in October in the <em>American Sociological Review</em>, found that non-citizens are penalized more harshly than similarly-situated citizens in the US criminal justice system. <a href="http://www.nyulawreview.org/sites/default/files/pdf/NYULawReview-88-4-Eagly.pdf" target="_blank">Earlier work by Ingrid Eagly</a>, published in the <em>NYU Law Review</em> in 2013, found that government agents in Maricopa County took immigration status into account in the criminal justice process in ways that designedly resulted in heavier punishments for noncitizens. In short, citizenship status definitely matters in the US criminal justice system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The outcome of the<em> Lopez-Valenzuela </em>case is unlikely to impact significantly the broad range of practices―from bail denials to sentencing schemes―that generate the disparities uncovered in these recent scholarly accounts. More work is needed to fully document the specific mechanisms that generate disparate outcomes for citizens and noncitizens across the criminal justice system. This work should be accompanied by systematic efforts to explicate and test the justifications offered in support of the differential treatment of citizens and noncitizens. In future work, I hope to explore these themes by studying anti-trafficking laws, which are alienage-neutral on their face, yet may nevertheless be used to focus criminal justice resources on noncitizens. I also hope to use that case study to better understand how racial bias in the criminal justice system may intersect with and confound apparent citizenship bias.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Post by <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/people/anaaliverti/" target="_blank">Ana Aliverti</a>, Assistant Professor at Warwick Law School, University of Warwick. This post is the first installment of the Border Criminologies <strong>Themed Week on Migration, Criminal Law</strong></em><em><strong> and Criminal Justice</strong> organised by Ana.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This themed week’s blogs will explore different aspects of the intersections between migration, criminal law, and criminal justice. As social institutions are being shaped by unprecedented levels of human movement and the attendant set of controls, criminal justice systems in many developed countries are required to deal with a fast-changing population. For instance, those who are foreign-born make up a quarter of the US federal prison population, while foreigners constitute more than one tenth of the English and Welsh one. They also figure prominently in the prison populations of other European countries. While we don’t know precisely how often criminal courts deal with defendants who are non-citizens, a few days observation of court proceedings in lower courts sitting in the main cities of these countries is revealing of the nature and extent of the impact that mass migration and its control has had on domestic criminal justice systems.</p>
<div id="attachment_5781" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://citizen.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2015/05/web7-602x400.jpg?091c3b" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-5781 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/web7-602x400-300x199.jpg" alt="Photo: Alaister Russell " width="300" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">(Photo: Alaister Russell)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This drastic demographic change unsettles the basic premises under which the criminal law and the criminal justice system functions. Perhaps the most important assumption is that the mandates of the criminal law chiefly address the members of a political community (their citizens) who at least in principle have a say in law-making and a duty to abide by it. State punishment is equally underpinned by such assumption. Again, at least in principle, convicted defendants <em>qua</em> citizens are required to expiate their wrongs and cleanse their bodies and souls to ultimately gain back their status as members. Yet, on a daily basis, the criminal courts are increasingly called to pass judgments on individuals who are excluded from political participation and are deemed to be territorially pushed out through the operation of stringent deportation regimes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rising numbers of non-citizen clientele of the criminal justice system poses more mundane but troubling challenges to its operation. As <a href="http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198258438.do" target="_blank">Paul Rock</a> in his seminal work on the crown court explains, criminal proceedings are underpinned by a recurrent appeal to common sense. Common sense, Rock asserts, can be conceived as an ‘objectification of the practical knowledge that motivates, explains, and organizes mundane experiences.’ The importance of common sense in criminal proceedings takes for granted the existence of a single, uniform, and homogeneous frame of reference under which defendants, practitioners, judges, and juries operate. Such an assumption is, however, denied over and over again by abundant signs of normative fragmentation. For example, in a magistrates’ court hearing that I recently observed, one of the defendant’s family members, who was sitting in the public gallery, pulled out his mobile and took a picture of the proceedings. The hearing was interrupted, and he was taken into police custody and charged with contempt of court. In his defence, he argued that he didn’t know that he was doing something illegal since in his country this action wasn’t a crime. These and many other mundane episodes disrupt the seemingly smooth and monotonous pace of court proceedings, casting doubts at least for a moment on those deep-seated assumptions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quite basic questions which form the ‘bread and butter’ of the preparation of a case for practitioners, court administrators, and probationer officers often have no clear answers: does the defendant have any criminal record? Does s/he have any history of mental health issue? How strong is his or her connection to this country? Is s/he who s/he pretends to be? How likely is s/he to flee from the country before finishing his or her suspended sentence? The incomplete and imperfect factual basis on which life changing decisions are made casts serious doubts about the fairness of those decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-5782 alignleft" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tn.php_-300x185.jpg" alt="tn.php" width="300" height="185" />Yet, our knowledge about the fundamental challenges posed by mass migration to equal and fair criminal justice adjudication is patchy and anecdotal. My current research seeks to disentangle the importance of citizenship and migration status for criminal justice decision-making through the analysis of the daily business of the criminal courts serving Birmingham, one of the most diverse cities in the UK. Paradoxically, a key methodological pitfall we’ve encountered so far is the difficulty in identifying who is a ‘foreign national’ given that information about formal citizenship and/or migration status isn’t recorded by the courts. Such difficulty poses challenges for identifying and sampling cases of interest, and more generally for accurately assessing whether and how citizenship matters in criminal justice decision-making. It also illustrates the complexities in determining alienage and migration status.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This themed week offers a glance at the multiple and intricate ways in which migration matters for understanding current laws and practices, both in the UK and US. It draws together scholars working at the intersections of criminal law, criminal justice, and migration to share their research findings. Some of these contributors will be presenting their work in the forthcoming <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/research/projects/" target="_blank">‘Criminal Adjudication in the Age of Migration: An International Workshop’</a> at the University of Oxford in March 2016, which will bring together scholars from various jurisdictions with practitioners to share and exchange experiences, ideas, and challenges of conducting research in this area, and scrutinise current practices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the themed week’s second installment, <a href="http://www.law.uci.edu/faculty/full-time/chacon/" target="_blank">Jennifer Chacon</a> analyzes the court ruling which put a halt to recent proposals in Arizona to ‘legalize differential treatment of unauthorized migrants in the criminal justice system’ by excluding those charged with certain felonies from being granted bail. Next, Jasmine Nogo focuses on the vulnerability of non-US national juvenile defendants who are often at risk of being treated as adults and thus subject to deportation upon a criminal conviction, even for relatively minor offences. Moving to the UK, in the fourth installment, <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/people/rachelseoighe/" target="_blank">Rachel Seoighe</a> looks at the most apparent features of cases involving foreign-nationals: the intervention of court interpreters. She draws attention to the ways in which interpreters significantly affect the pace and interactions in court hearing, and can dramatically shape the fate and course of the case―sometimes to the detriment of defendants. In scrutinising the function of the criminal law in the criminalisation of refugees, <a href="http://www.law.qmul.ac.uk/research/students/86401.html" target="_blank">Yewa Holiday</a> questions the very basis for holding them accountable according to general principles of criminal law. Drawing parallels with vagrancy laws, she suggests that laws criminalizing refugees are a modern revival of status liability and argues that these offences criminalize types of people rather than acts, thus disrupting one of the main tenets of liberal criminal law. In the final installment, <a href="https://www.cla.purdue.edu/sociology/directory/?p=Michael_Light" target="_blank">Michael Light</a> charts an agenda for future research on the intersections between immigration and criminal law, suggesting three main directions: increased international comparative research, an emphasis on robust methodologies to identify the mechanisms behind ‘legal inequality,’ and a better understanding of the impact of incarceration on foreign nationals and their families.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Together, the contributions for this themed week reflect on some of the most troubling aspects of the exclusionary edge of citizenship and its relevance to understanding the contemporary contours of punitive power.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5749" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/4dee1d7e6-300x200.jpg" alt="4dee1d7e6" width="300" height="200" />Triggers of movement are complex for refugee mothers and, as the above quote makes clear, many feel they have little choice other than to migrate. There’s no one reason, nor can the decision to move be boiled down simply to fear. Examining these migration motivations isn’t to say that mothers don’t cite fear for their lives as a reason for migration. However, there are specific gendered triggers of movement for these mothers which are also affected by other factors, such as country of origin and class. Theory around push and pull factors is often credited to <a href="http://www.students.uni-mainz.de/jkissel/Skripte/Lee.pdf" target="_blank">Everett Lee</a>’s work on migration in which he outlines how people (in this case, men) decide to leave ‘origin’ countries and move to ‘destination’ countries. Push factors can be defined in a multitude of ways, on levels from macro to micro reasons (see, for example, work by <a href="http://www.iom.cz/files/Women_and_migration_Social_Consequences_of_Gender_1_.pdf" target="_blank">Silvia Pedraza</a> and <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/800079" target="_blank">Saskia Sassen-Koob</a>) which contribute to life situations which cause, in the words of <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guido_Dorigo/publication/200820374_Push-pull_migration_laws/links/54bd64360cf218d4a16a27bd.pdf" target="_blank">Guido Dorigo and Waldo Tobler</a>, someone to ‘be dissatisfied with one’s present locale.’ This definition cannot fully encompass the complications around why people migrate and how these may culminate in a migratory journey. Push factors as a terminology may also dismiss the agency in decisions to migrate. Beyond these issues, women travelling with children clearly extend the framework of decision-making beyond an individualised model of push and pull factors which have been previously discussed within the literature. Due to the problematic nature of the push/pull dichotomy, I’ve chosen to use ‘migration motivations’ and ‘triggers of movement’ instead of ‘push factors.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Migration and Motherhood Project</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This post draws on my <a href="http://profiles.arts.monash.edu.au/brandy-cochrane/motherhood-and-migration/" target="_blank">doctoral research</a> in which I’m speaking with asylum-seeking and refugee mothers from Iran and Afghanistan on how these women negotiate their security, agency, and mobility within the context of illegalised migration to Australia. In the context of semi-structured interviews to discuss the crossroads between motherhood and migration, the women have shared a variety of migratory experiences with me. Speaking to these two groups of women isn’t meant to structure a strict comparative study between them. Rather, the inclusion of both groups permits a wider range of intersections to be analysed, such as those between the situations in home countries, paths of migration, class, and differing gender roles within the family context. In what follows, I touch on some of the initial themes surrounding migration from these mothers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Emergent Triggers</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Migration motivations for these mothers are important as there’s a lack of understanding around the experiences of this context. This project begins to uncover what it might be like to be faced with extreme situations of migration with children in tow or how the complicating factors of pregnancy might affect migration. These additional factors affect the fundamental foundations of why people are on the move and are necessary to explore in order to better support these populations before, during, and after their migratory journeys.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many of the women I spoke with discussed family abuses and structural issues around gender roles in their home countries within their motivation to migrate. These underlying structural barriers were tied with policies that for the allowed abuse, control, and confinement of women by family members and partners. This wasn’t just the case in the marital relationship, but rather an extended network of controls which occurred in women’s home countries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She forced for this marriage and she doesn’t like him…her husband was 40 and she was 15 and not understand…she asked him if he wanted to go, not stay, because he hits and lots of problems happened….He forced me to stay in the house, all the time when I’d go out, I’d have something to do, he just forced me to get back to the house because in the community in Iran, no woman goes out. She mustn’t because she is under his hand. He has influence on her because they are marries and the government and the law—she cannot go out. Roya (late 30s, mother of one son)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other gendered triggers of movement emerged in the narratives which could be tied to other conditions within home countries. For instance, Afghan women were more likely to talk about general personal safety as mothers in a war zone faced with a lack of access to education for themselves and their daughters. Iranian women were more likely to speak of/about direct government harassment of themselves and their children as factors influencing their decision to migrate. Both groups spoke of/about pregnancy being a trigger. Sometimes they were unmarried. At other times they were concerned about the safety of their unborn child.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-5750 alignleft" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/xmm510-300x200.jpg" alt="Pakistan Afghan Refugee Mothers" width="300" height="200" />It’s clear that borders are permeable for some and not for others. Captured quite clearly by <a href="https://www.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=yCLFBfZwl08C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=Lyon,+D.+(Ed.).+(2003).+Surveillance+as+social+sorting:+Privacy,+risk,+and+digital+discrimination.+Psychology+Press.&amp;ots=g54Li5kn5s&amp;sig=U60-6KgYM9Eg_LubadfJA2pou80" target="_blank">David Lyon’s</a> use of the term ‘social sorting,’ this border permeability is distinguished along the lines of gender, nationality, and class. It’s already difficult to enter a country’s borders for asylum seekers, but within these distinctions is the ability to choose the mode of travel and other options. This ‘ability to choose’ is, of course, must be understand in the rigid constraints of Australian border controls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Class impacted on some gendered migration motivations, specifically in the realm of transport within these women’s stories. Iranian families, many of whom had higher socio-economic statuses, were able to afford the more immediate and costly option of travelling by boat. Afghan women, despite their wish to travel by boat with their male partners, were more likely to spend long periods of time in Pakistan while their partners negotiated their way to Australia and gained permanent status. Indeed, migrating by boat wasn’t an easy option:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She said because it’s very difficult to come [by boat]…Because of the cost and because of the safety. Zarlashta (29 years old, mother of two)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This short blog post cannot touch on each of the themes which have emerged to create the various pressures for mothers to move from their home country. All of the women with whom I’ve spoken were in some way in fear of their lives or the lives of their children. However, this project has illuminated that this process is more complicated than simple danger and is tied up with structural gendered issues that are confounded by class and country of origin. It’s my intention to further pull apart these complicated motivations in order to form an understanding of how asylum-seeking mothers begin their hazardous journeys from their home countries</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5764" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Seattle_logo_250_tm.jpg" alt="Seattle_logo_250_tm" width="250" height="266" />This year’s annual Law and Society Association (LSA) conference, ‘<a href="http://www.lawandsociety.org/Seattle2015/seattle2015.html" target="_blank">Law’s Promise and Law&#8217;s Pathos in the Global North and Global South</a>,’ held in Seattle, Washington, on 28 to 31 May 2015, offered an excellent program with many panels related to the themes of citizenship, migration, and border control across a range of jurisdictions in the context of law, criminology, and sociolegal studies. Indeed, the <a href="https://crn2.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Collaborative Research Network (CRN02) of the LSA on Citizenship and Immigration</a>, convened by Marjorie Zatz (Arizona State University), Jamie Longazael (University of Dayton), and Maartje van der Woude (University of Leiden), featured a remarkable number of panels (17!) exploring these themes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In one of these CRN02 sessions, ‘“We the people of Europe?”: How the Remaking of Borders is Remaking Europe (Part 2), <a href="http://www.crim.ox.ac.uk/profile.php?who=ines.hasselberg" target="_blank">Inês Hasselberg</a> and I co-presented a draft paper in which we’re exploring the carceral trajectories of male foreign-national prisoners in the United Kingdom. Drawing on our respective <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/reseach/current-research/" target="_blank">research projects here at Border Criminologies</a>, the paper considers the lived experiences of confinement across two carceral sites, prison and immigration detention. Our presentation focused on how the intertwined practices of imprisonment and detention coalesce within the UK ‘<a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/The-Deportation-Regime/" target="_blank">deportation regime</a>’ and change the character and experience of confinement for convicted men who aren’t British citizens.</p>
<div id="attachment_5767" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-5767 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015-05-29-12.54.24-1-225x300.jpg" alt="2015-05-29 12.54.24-1" width="225" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Seattle&#8217;s iconic Space Needle. (Photo: S. Turnbull)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The panel also included presentations by: Joanne van der Leun (University of Leiden) on the complexities of municipality-level migration control in the Netherlands; Patrick van Berlo (University of Leiden) regarding the privatisation and outsourcing of ‘crimmigration’ control, including detection, at the borderlands of Europe; Katie Cruz (Keele University) on the problematic frame of ‘trafficking’ as the primary way in which states understand migrant sex work; and Annalisa Lendaro (French National Center for Scientific Research) on the topic of migrants’ mobilisations and protests in Lampedusa, Italy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other CRN02 panels focused on key ongoing and emerging areas of scholarship, including: the parallels between mass incarceration and mass deportation in the US context, the use of risk assessments in immigration detention, state techniques of immigration control, and (im)migrant activism and organising.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was great to see other <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/about/academic-researchers/" target="_blank">members of the Border Criminologies network</a> at the conference presenting their work. <a href="http://www.su.se/profiles/vbark-1.187477" target="_blank">Vanessa Barker</a> (Stockholm University) provided a critical analysis of how increased border control is changing fundamental aspects of criminal justice systems across Europe, thereby posing problems for our understanding of European penality and the European project more generally. Drawing on research from her new book <a href="http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198712602.do" target="_blank"><em>Punish and Expel: Border Control, Nationalism, and the New Purpose of the Prison</em></a> (Oxford University Press, 2015), <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/about/students/" target="_blank">Emma Kaufman</a> (Yale Law School) discussed how the priorities of border control are being transported into US prisons for foreign nationals and thus challenging the traditional purposes of the prison and punishment. <a href="http://www.ucmerced.edu/content/tanya-golash-boza" target="_blank">Tanya Golash-Boza</a>’s (University of California, Merced) presentation focused on issues of race and deportation based on her research with Jamaican and Dominican deportees. <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/about/academic-researchers/" target="_blank">Mario João Guia</a> (University of Coimbra) commented on issues of inclusion and exclusion of migrants in the European Union, particularly in relation to the dichotomy of European citizen/third country national.</p>
<div id="attachment_5768" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-5768 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015-05-30-20.02.12-300x300.jpg" alt="2015-05-30 20.02.12" width="300" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Local commentary from Seattle on a building near the LSA conference site. (Photo: S. Turnbull)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Several members of <a href="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/about/advisory-group/" target="_blank">Border Criminologies’ advisory group</a> were also in attendance at the LSA. <a href="https://socialecology.uci.edu/faculty/scoutin" target="_blank">Susan Coutin</a> (University of California, Irvine) presented a paper on the identity documents that Salvadoran migrants use and create to travel to the US and seek legal residency. She also participated in a ‘Methods Café’ session on ethnography. The presentation by <a href="https://law.lclark.edu/live/profiles/305-juliet-stumpf" target="_blank">Juliet Stumpf</a> (Lewis &amp; Clark Law School) explored how pressures for legal change in immigration law in the US have resulted in ‘liminal law’―that is, structures and processes that operate as law but are merely law-like.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by </em><a href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/amanda-spalding(e869982c-a948-48aa-bd4d-368b63a8a744).html" target="_blank"><em>Amanda Spalding</em></a><em>, PhD candidate at Kings College London and a teaching fellow of ECHR and EU law at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS).</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Review of <a href="http://www.hartpub.co.uk/BookDetails.aspx?ISBN=9781849465892" target="_blank"><em>The Law and Practice of Expulsion and Exclusion from the United Kingdom: Deportation, Removal, Exclusion and Deprivation of Citizenship</em></a> edited by Eric Fripp (Hart Publishing, 2015).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="http://www.hartpub.co.uk/BookDetails.aspx?ISBN=9781849465892" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5437"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5437" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/fripp-book-203x300.jpg" alt="fripp book" width="203" height="300" /></a>The Law and Practice of Expulsion and Exclusion from the United Kingdom</em> focuses on the laws governing the deportation, removal, and exclusion of persons from the territory of the UK, as well as the deprivation of citizenship. It’s the first book to provide comprehensive guidance to the law and practice in this area of state power. The thorough research included in this volume reflects the fact that it’s intended to be used in ‘real-life’ by practitioners and is written with them in mind. This is evident by the long list of contributors, all of whom are practicing barristers. In the preface to the book, the editor, Eric Fripp, and the two deputy editors, Rowena Moffat and Ellis Wilford, make a convincing case for the importance of studying this particular area of the law. They argue that it’s of constitutional significance: who becomes and remains a citizen has democratic consequences because the law determines who is, and who is not, a political actor. The editors also highlight the impact of these decisions on individuals and the need to ensure that the rule of law is respected, particularly where such laws grant much discretion to the executive. This argument is especially relevant given the clear increase in the breadth and use of these powers in recent years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The book covers not only domestic law but also the expansive legal framework which influences UK law in this area, including the relevant European Union and Council of Europe instruments as well as public international law, international human rights law, and the international laws relating to refugee law, statelessness, and human trafficking. Part B of the text provides an in-depth look at all of these relevant laws while providing some background to them, the relevant provisions and explanation as to how they work in practice. This provides the reader with the necessary context and a useful reference tool for the issues considered in the rest of the book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Part C of <em>The Law and Practice of Expulsion and Exclusion from the United Kingdom</em> deals with the three main ways a person may be expelled or excluded from the UK: (1) deportation, which is where someone may be required to leave the UK because their presence isn’t desirable; (2) administrative removal, which is the process by which someone who’s in the UK unlawfully may be removed; and (3) exclusion, which refers to state’s right to refuse entry to those without the right of abode. Part D of the book addresses the law governing both the denial and deprivation of British citizenship, while Part E outlines the potential remedies available, both domestically and internationally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This book is really a practitioner’s guide and isn’t intended to be read to cover-to-cover by most readers. However, it still underscores some significant thematic points, most prominent of which is the importance of international law in this area, especially the relevance of the European Union and the Council of Europe. A good example of this is the thorough consideration of the limits that Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (that is, the right to respect for private and family life) places on the UK’s ability to deport and remove foreign nationals. The significance of this provision is made clear by the attempts of the Home Office to limit its effect and curtail court discretion (most recently see <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/22/section/19/enacted" target="_blank">Section 19 of the Immigration Act 2014</a>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another important issue is the extremely broad discretion now held by the Secretary of State concerning the power to deprive a person of their British citizenship. This practice may now be pursued if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the deprivation is ‘conducive to the public good.’ Given the broad terms used in describing when the Secretary of State may find deprivation ‘conducive to the public good,’ there are few limits on this power. To make matters worse, this power is often used when individuals are outside of the UK, which leaves them stranded abroad and prevents their recourse to UK courts―see, for example, the case of<a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/906.html" target="_blank"> L1 v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 906</a>. This trend reflects a worrying attitude of the Home Office that’s evident throughout the book: the continuing effort to widen executive discretion and hinder access to court as much as possible. This issue is further highlighted in Part E of the book in which contributors demonstrate the reluctance of the UK to participate fully in international human rights law. The UK has so far failed to sign the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 which would allow individuals to petition the United Nations Human Rights Committee for a judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, <em>The Law and Practice of Expulsion and Exclusion from the United Kingdom</em> provides an analytical and comprehensive legal account of the relevant law and practice in areas of deportation, removal, and exclusion from the UK, and the denial and deprivation of British citizenship. Given the increasing tension between the Home Office’s desire to expand its discretion and control in these areas and the courts’ need to protect their independence and the rights of individuals, there’s been continuously growing legislation and case-law in this area. Thus, this comprehensive and reliable book should be welcomed by practitioners and those who study this area of the law.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Spanish newspaper <a href="http://verne.elpais.com/verne/2015/01/20/articulo/1421773872_248222.html" target="_blank">El Pais recently listed the Colombia-Venezuela border</a> as one of the seven hells on earth that one should never visit―next to places such as the Islamic State, northern Nigeria, and Somalia. Insight Crime, a research foundation analysing organised crime in Latin America, <a href="http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/top-5-most-dangerous-border-regions-in-latin-america?utm_source=Master+List&amp;utm_campaign=906f25d7a1-01_30_151_29_2015&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_e90c5425f9-906f25d7a1-206741885" target="_blank">counts the border among the five most dangerous borders of the region</a>, next to the violence-ridden US-Mexico border.</p>
<div id="attachment_5742" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-5742 size-medium" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/AnnetteIdler2.png-225x300.jpg" alt="AnnetteIdler2.png" width="225" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Border police post (Photo: A. Idler)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are plenty of reasons for this infamous reputation. The Colombia-Venezuela border region is affected by the half-century old Colombian civil war. Notorious for contraband dating back to the sixteenth century, smuggling today includes products ranging from household goods and food, to gasoline, arms, ammunitions, humans, and drugs. The border area comprises some of the most important starting points of the international trafficking routes towards Europe and the US. The lines between legal and illegal cross-border activities are blurred, not least because for the indigenous Wayúu, resident in the Guajira Peninsula in the northern part of the border, this Western-imposed line doesn’t exist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I witnessed when carrying out research on my own along the Colombia-Venezuela border, the presence of multiple violent non-state elements, including guerrillas, right-wing groups, and drug cartels, makes the region a difficult place to visit. Conflict actors exert territorial and social control on both sides of the border; cocaine is smuggled in any thinkable way; women are kidnapped for human trafficking; and border officials supplement poor salaries with bribes. Still, when it comes to crossing the border, the risks aren’t clearly visible. There is no fortified wall as at the US-Mexico border. There isn’t a deep ocean to cross on a life-risking journey as across the Mediterranean Sea. And there are no robot border guards pointing their guns at people who attempt to cross the borderline as at the Korean North-South divide. And yet, there is a constant unease and pre-sentiment that something might happen. There is the feeling of being a potential victim, the normalised perpetual fear that arises from moving from one place to another―inconceivable to me before having experienced it myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Studying these borderlands is even more dangerous as academic research might be interpreted incorrectly by onlookers. This is an environment where mistrust and suspicion reign. By definition, illegal business deals are not legally binding; betrayal and cheating are omnipresent. Not only is this reflected in the relationships among different violent non-state groups, but among local community members as well. Coming into communities at the Colombia-Venezuela border as a stranger to do fieldwork doesn’t make things easier. Certainly, being an outsider can help: devoid of previous allegiances with any of the sides and of any institutional affiliation that may be judged in certain ways, especially in the highly politicised Colombian and Venezuelan societies, one can be perceived to be impartial. Yet, at the same time, personalising the ‘unknown’ to any local interlocutor can also represent a challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The danger of being victimised when researching such uncanny borderlands makes constantly negotiating new trust relationships essential. Planning multi-sited fieldwork across borders involves establishing contacts, finding accommodation, booking flights, working out back-up plans, and locating bus timetables for each new site. During my fieldwork, local contact persons offered their support, accompanied me to the research sites, and/or invited me to stay in their homes, but I typically had little time to get to know them very well. In most villages I only stayed between one and seven days. Given the time constraints, I often had to rely on recommendations from trusted previous interviewees as my only reference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Citing <a href="http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/63/4/967.short?rss=1&amp;ssource=mfc" target="_blank">Lewis and Weigert</a>, <a href="http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415489355/" target="_blank">Norman</a> differentiates between cognitive and personal, or emotional, trust; cognitive trust ‘is based on a cognitive process which discriminates amongst persons and institutions that are trustworthy, distrusted and unknown.’ Guided by interests, this ‘thin’ trust is in line with a rational choice approach to decision-making. Emotional trust is rooted in personal relationships. These two forms help foster understanding of trust relationships in a relatively stable context after having spent some time at a specific research site. I found a third form crucial to quickly adapting to the multiple new research contexts and to travelling between them: intuitive trust. The <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/intuition" target="_blank">Oxford Dictionaries define intuition</a> as ‘the ability to understand something instinctively, without the need for conscious reasoning.’ Where lacking information on people and in the absence of time to slowly establish rapport and build ‘thick’ trust, the gut feeling in combination with interpersonal skills tell you whether to trust people or not. In ‘normal’ circumstances, intuiting wrongly may lead to a lost opportunity; in conflict zones and other violent contexts, this may cost one’s life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following anecdote on how I attempted to cross the border between the Venezuelan state of Zulia and the Colombian department of La Guajira illustrates the dilemma of intuition. The dilemma results from the necessity to trust strangers while travelling between research sites on the one hand, and the anxiety arising from doubting one’s gut feeling, on the other.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Zulia, Venezuela, I stayed for a week at the place of a Wayúu school teacher who recommended me to cross the border with her brother. I trusted her recommendation and my gut feeling told me that it was also okay to travel with his friend in his friend’s car, when he suggested to do so. We started the trip and after several military checkpoints in which my luggage was searched, we reached the Colombian side of the border. The teacher’s brother decided to hitchhike back to his village and told me to continue with his friend to a town in Colombian La Guajira. This friend would take me to another friend’s place where I could stay some nights. But shortly after crossing the border, a thunderstorm started, the car broke down, and the supposed friend in the Colombian town didn’t pick up her mobile phone and apparently no-one knew where she lived. I became scared. Being an important cocaine trafficking and gasoline smuggling corridor, the route we were taking was supposedly controlled by various actors benefitting from the illegal business: right-wing armed groups, FARC, local gangs, and members of the Venezuelan military. As long as people adhere to their rules, things are fine. Any deviation causes mistrust which can have security implications. What if the friend was involved with any of these armed groups? What if his intention wasn’t to bring me to the friend in Colombia, but to kidnap me? I had relied on my Wayúu friend who had told me her brother would care for me. I relied on her brother’s judgement according to which his friend would support me. But could I trust him? After a while in the broken car in the middle of nowhere under the pouring rain, we stopped a taxi. I was taken to a Wayúu leader’s <em>ranchería</em><em>―</em>the Wayúu’s basic housing<em>―</em>in a violent neighbourhood on the outskirts of the Colombian town. It was dark as we discussed what to do. Finally my companions took me to the place of another friend I didn’t know, in a more central and safer area. I stayed a couple of nights there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I succeeded in crossing the border. I intuited correctly; the people I interacted with were supportive. Nevertheless, the risks linked to following intuition and the uncertainty of not being able to build cognitive or emotional trust fuelled my anxiety. This anxiety taught me a lesson: anxiety, intertwined with a desire to reach one’s destination in the midst of potential dangers on the way, is important to understanding the borderlanders’ security concerns. That is, while in many countries people are concerned with arriving on time, borderlanders are concerned with arriving at all, and therefore limit travelling to the necessary and prefer to stay in a familiar location with trusted people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Such time-limited, multi-sited fieldwork, especially across and around borders, demonstrates the importance of intuitive trust. Rather than studying textbooks, building intuitive trust requires sharpening interpersonal skills and paying attention to the local environment. On this basis, intuitive trust has a double effect: it’s conducive to successful fieldwork with reduced security risks while also enhancing understanding of the local communities who live in fragile contexts such as the Colombia-Venezuela border where crime and conflict dynamics converge. Understanding these communities is the first step to working towards improving their situations.</p>

(Photo: A. Idler)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, this fieldwork helped me realise that the border between ‘hell’ and ‘paradise’ can be a fine one. The Colombia-Venezuela border region indeed suffers conflict, crime, marginalisation, and stigmatisation, which can produce an image of hell. Many members of the Colombian state forces also consider being based in that region a punishment. Yet, the hospitality, warmth, and positive outlook of people like the Wayúu teacher and her brother unhinge this one-sided picture. Perhaps it’s for this reason that someone wrote graffiti next to the border police station Castilletes, the most northern point of the Colombia-Venezuela border, that reads: ‘Never compare this paradise with a punishment. Enjoy it!’</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>In this post, a couple separated through forced return in the United States share their experiences of deportation and its far-reaching consequences. The stories, submitted by email, have been edited for language and to ensure anonymity. The names are pseudonyms.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5713" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Keep-Families-Together-300x199.jpg" alt="Keep-Families-Together" width="300" height="199" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sandra </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My husband, Frederico, came to the United States in 1972. His father had migrated years before and worked hard to bring his wife and three children to America to join him. My husband was the youngest of the three children. Frederico was my life partner for 32 years but my husband for eight years. We were home owners and tax payers. I’m Native American from a federally recognized Indian tribe. I know nothing about immigration or immigration law. On 24 October 2011, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers came to my home while my husband was working in the yard and informed me that Frederico was here working illegally. Not knowing any better, I ran into the house and came back with his passport and green card; after all, my husband was a permanent resident for 41 years. Officers took my husband, telling me that he’d be released in a couple of hours. Yet, Frederico was detained and then deported back to Cape Verde―a place he doesn’t remember, with a language he doesn’t speak, and somewhere he has no family at all. This is because his parents and grandparents are all buried here in the US. Frederico and I have four children and nine grandchildren who miss him so much because he was so abruptly ripped from us with no warning. It’s been three and a half years now and my husband still hasn’t found employment in Cape Verde. I work hard to try to support him and pay our bills here while taking care of him there. I love and miss my husband. I want the US government to do more to reunite legal immigrants back with their families. I don’t understand how my husband can be legally married with a family, having been here legally to work and pay taxes, and after 41 years not be considered a citizen. After 32 years of our life together, I’m middle age and all alone and so is Frederico. These should be our golden years together. I don’t think the government knows the devastation it causes by separating families.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5714" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/shattered-immigrant-family-portrait-300x229.jpg" alt="shattered-immigrant-family-portrait" width="300" height="229" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Frederico</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hi, my name is Frederico. I immigrated to the US in 1972 with my entire family at the age of eight. My parents and grandparents are all buried in the US. I was a 41-year legally documented permanent resident, who was raised enjoying the rich history, culture, and traditions America offered me. In July 2007, I married my companion of 31 years, Sandra, a Native American, in a civil ceremony ordained by a Justice of the Peace. In July 2010, I went to the Cape Verdean American Community Center to inquire about getting a new Portuguese passport as mine had expired 1984. I paid a $50.00 fee and was issued a Cape Verdean passport that same month instead. It seemed odd because all my legal documents are Portuguese, not Cape Verdean. In August 2010, my wife and I embarked on a seven-day cruise for our honeymoon. While departing the ship at the port of Miami, Florida, I was held up as a US customs officer examined my passport with suspicion. I received a new permanent resident card with an expiration date in 2021, yet on 24 October 2011, ICE officers apprehended me while I was working on my home. They claimed that I was illegal and asked my wife for the passport which she handed over with my permanent card. In January 2012, I was issued a deportation order. Eighteen days later, on 21 February 2012, I was put on a plane. Without thinking, my wife took the plane with me and we were dropped off in Praia, the capital city of Cape Verde, a place I’d never seen in my life. I was appalled to learn I was issued a fraudulent Cape Verdean passport. Through this whole ordeal, I haven’t been represented by an attorney. I was born in a Portuguese colony as a Portuguese national; my birth certificate is Portuguese. I have been taken away from my wife, family, and home in the US.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by Damien Simonneau, Centre Emile Durkheim, Sciences Po Bordeaux, Université de Bordeaux. </em><em>Damien is a contributor to the French research website </em><a href="http://enigmur.hypotheses.org/" target="_blank"><em>Enigmur</em></a><em> on walls and borders. Follow him on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/damsim" target="_blank">@DamSim</a>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Review of <a href="http://nyupress.org/books/9781479847761/" target="_blank"><em>Border Politics: Social Movements, Collective Identities, and Globalization</em></a>, edited by Nancy A Naples and Jennifer Bickham Mendez (New York University Press, 2015).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://nyupress.org/books/9781479847761/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-5188"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5188" src="http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/BorderPolitics-200x300.jpg" alt="BorderPolitics" width="200" height="300" /></a>For critical border scholars, it’s clear that social reality isn’t two-dimensional as the border order claims when it mobilizes <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-5687.2007.00001.x/abstract" target="_blank">binaries such as ‘us/them,’ ‘inside/outside,’ ‘citizen/alien.’</a> <em>Border Politics: Social Movements, Collective Identities, and Globalization</em> challenges this order by exploring the multi-faceted aspect of bordering, interpreted here as a process. Drawing on the works of Chicana feminists like <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/borderlands-la-frontera-gloria-anzaldua/1100921594?ean=9781879960749" target="_blank">Gloria Anzaldúa</a> and the field of <a href="http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9780754674061" target="_blank">border studies</a>, the editors conceptualize ‘border politics’ as ‘<em>struggles that challenge, transcend, or reinforce territorial borders and their effects, or that contest borders within nationally defined territories, including social and symbolic boundaries of inclusion and exclusio</em>n’ (p. 4). The aim is to understand the links between geopolitical borders and other types of social and symbolic boundaries ‘<em>as they become both objects and sites of struggle’</em> (p. 4). The edited collection offers an important contribution to the sociology of bordering. Rather than focusing on struggles over the militarization of geographical borderlands as outlined by scholars like <a href="http://zedbooks.co.uk/node/20846" target="_blank">Reece Jones</a>, the contribution of the book lies in its original approach to the analysis of social movements for which borders and boundaries are sites of struggle. More precisely, the chapters depict how these social movements maintain, contest, produce, and dissolve borders and boundaries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The book is comprised of eleven case studies based on ethnographic data and organized into three thematic sections. Part 1 examines border politics taking gender as a category of analysis. Social movements are depicted as sites in which discourses and practices have considered women as the embodiment of a national or ethnic community that symbolically maintains national and ethnic boundaries. Jennifer L. Johnson (Chapter 2) describes how the identity of ‘grandmotherhood’ was performed by the Minutemen border policing movement in Arizona in 2007. In Chapter 3, Meera Sehgal  illustrates how women are transformed by the Samiti Hindu nationalist movement in India into ‘border guards’ who deepen and regulate boundaries between Hindus and Muslims. Duncan McDuie-Ra (Chapter 4) focuses on the implication of women’s organizations for peace during tensions between Naga and Meitei communities in North-East India, highlighting the limits of the discursive use of ‘motherhood’ in mobilizing political action, which isn’t effective enough to cross ethnic boundaries. Queering the gaze, Moon M. Charania’s Chapter 5 analyses media coverage of Lal Masjid women’s protest in Pakistan in 2007. She shows how these black burqa women are represented as ‘erotic nationals,’ caught in between the imperial look that eroticizes them and the look of the war on terror that demonizes them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Part 2 of <em>Border Politics</em> focuses on the fluid meaning of boundaries that social movements seek to defend according to their strategies and political environment. This section invites the reader to go beyond the officially professed binary discourse of borders. In Chapter 6, Sarah Maddison, focusing on Australia, discusses how the indigenous identity is shifting from a colonial construct to a politicized identity mobilized by indigenous peoples themselves to transcend precolonial borders and fight for self-governance and autonomy in a (post)colonial nation. Deana A. Rohlinger and co-authors (Chapter 7) investigate boundary shifts in Florida’s Tea Party movement as a response to the incorporation of the movement’s ideas into the political apparatus in 2010 and to the emergence of the Occupy movement. In Chapter 8, Maple Razsa and Andrej Kurnik trace the protests of Slovenia’s labour migrants from countries of the former Yugoslavia who live under the threat of illegality as Yugoslavia was disintegrated and then integrated into the European Union. In Chapter 9, Phillip M. Ayoub and David Paternotte turn the gaze to Central and Eastern Europe where being LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) is equated to being European. They underline the role played by LGBT activists in building Europe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Part 3 analyzes the conditions for cross-border solidarities among localized movements and transnational advocacy networks. These contributions reveal ‘border distortion’ effects among transnational networks that aim to overcome borders and boundaries. In Chapter 10, Yvonne Braun and Michael Dreiling illustrate the limits of cross-border coordination between the network International Rivers and activists in Lesotho challenging a mega-dam water project. The ‘border distortion’ takes place when International Rivers neglects claims at local level in order to provide congruity to their transnational movement identity. Renata Blumberg and Raphi Rechitsky (Chapter 11) demonstrate how No Border activists developed boundaries among themselves within a camp at the Ukrainian borderlands in 2007. In Chapter 12, Michelle Tellez and Cristina Sanidad explore mobilizations in the San Diego-Tijuana borderland to defend the rights of workers in assembly factories (<em>maquiladoras</em>). Such social movements frame border dwellers as active agents for social change and the geographical borderland as a site of resistance against globalization.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, the book provides an original approach to disrupt binaries and encourage us to think of bordering in terms of process. However, by mixing symbolic, social, and geographical boundaries, the book reduces ‘the border’ to a metaphor that enables analyses of the political production of difference or conflict without providing any middle-range concepts to operationalize such a process of demarcation. Logics of demarcation in these different types of boundaries are distinct (e.g., feelings of belonging, inequalities, sovereignty, security) and could perhaps have been dealt with individually using different theoretical and conceptual frameworks. The notable quality of <em>Border Politics</em> lies in the editors’ selection of contributions based on ethnographic data and thick description, as well as reflexivity regarding the purposes and politics of the research presented. Pleasant to read, each case study in <em>Border Politics </em>reveals how the ‘specifics of place’ are powerfully mobilized to grasp the micro-practices of bordering. Of particular interest to me were the immersions inside ‘protest camps’ offered in the chapters by Seghal, Johnson, and Blumberg and Rechitsky. The book’s theoretical positioning―a ‘<em>feminist, inter-sectional approach to border politics, informed by border theory</em>’ (p. 358)―also strengthens the analyses of bordering processes. <em>Border Politics</em> perfectly illustrates that the border is a ‘<a href="http://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:4376" target="_blank">bio-social invariant</a>’ that’s uneasy to escape.</p>
